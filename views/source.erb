<p style="max-width: 70%;">The original text for this project is based on letters written to or from British officials around the Atlantic, as collected in the Calendar of State Papers, colonial series. The Calendar, compiled by British archivists and scholars mainly in the years before 1950, has collected most of the documents in the Colonial Office files now at The National Archives, Kew, and transcribed many of them in full, while abstracting or abbreviating the contents of others. Since this project directly follows the text of the Calendar, it is subject to the same editorial conventions, rather than the original text of the documents. Most of the documents, nevertheless, can be found in their original form in the Colonial Office (CO) series of papers at The National Archives.</p>

<p style="max-width: 70%;">The current project contains a sample of British correspondence from a single year, 1731 - that is, one volume of the Calendar of State Papers - Colonial. As of May 2013, the data uploaded onto this site are all of the documents in <a href="http://archive.org/details/colonialrecord38greauoft">volume 38 of the Calendar</a>, (text downloaded from archive.org).</p>
