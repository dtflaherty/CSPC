<p style="max-width: 70%;">The objective in creating this tool was to visualize the broad scope of British officials’ knowledge of and interaction with places around the Atlantic Ocean in the early eighteenth century.  Many histories of the British Atlantic in the period before 1750 focus on a single colony or region, and many studies of British colonial administration have stressed officials’ ignorance about the geography of places large and small on the other side of the ocean.  While knowledge of places should not convey familiarity, this tool will allow scholars to map the points that were mentioned or discussed in a sampling of the correspondence of British officials, providing a version of their mental geography of the Atlantic world.  (As of April 2013, data has been entered only for the year 1731; see <a href="/source">Source</a> for more details.)</p>

<h4 style="font-size: 1.3em;">Conclusions</h4>

<p style="max-width: 70%;">This project suggests a new approach to the study of the British Atlantic empire, in which I seek to explain the vision of the officials tasked with managing its commercial growth and territorial expansion in the first half of the eighteenth century.  These officials - the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations who sat on the Board of Trade - may not have built a centrally controlled empire in the modern sense before 1763, but they envisioned and pursued a transatlantic sphere in which British sovereignty would be unquestioned and British subjects would exploit expanding economic opportunities, all to the benefit of the common “imperial” interest.  They did not “neglect” the colonies, but instead focused on measures of “improvement,” whereby they could expand the settler population, grow commerce, and bring frontier territories into secure possession while enlarging the available productive land for British subjects.  Whether or not this British Atlantic can properly be called an “empire,” it was nevertheless a historically significant political and economic entity. The Commissioners of Trade and Plantations and their correspondents developed a vision of a British empire that promoted this transatlantic common good and sought to implement that vision through control of contested frontier regions.</p>

<p style="max-width: 70%;">This “vision” has a crucial geographic component. Historians who focus on Parliament’s bumbled handling of the constitutional questions of empire in years before the American Revolution have latched on to a narrative of neglect and ignorance by British officials. By contrast, the Commissioners on the Board of Trade had instead a very keen sense of the lay of the land, so to speak, in the Atlantic.  Where were the British colonies, and how were they related to each other?  Where had more people, as opposed to fewer people, settled?  Where was there unclaimed territory that could be successfully exploited?  How close were French and Spanish outposts to British settlers?  Which points on the map of British America marked the greatest weaknesses in case of a war?  The Commissioners on the Board of Trade and their secretaries had access to all of this information in their archive at the Plantation Office.  This project is designed to visualize what these officials saw when they "looked" at the Atlantic.  They would have had a mental geography of some kind that made sense, for them, of the vast Atlantic world in which British interest, influence, and population were steadily growing.  What did that world look like?</p>

<p style="max-width: 70%;">For one thing, it is clear that both localized and broad knowledge of Atlantic geography remained valuable to the Board of Trade, based on the kind of information that they had and that they sought in their correspondence.  The model of the seventeenth century exchanges of geographic information exchanged would normally focus on travel narratives or speculative world maps that attempted to place newly discovered or newly settled American places relative to one another.  This time of geographic understanding remained a part of how British officials attempted to further their understanding of the Atlantic in the eighteenth century.  But they also received extensive detailed information about several different areas.  In the example of 1731 presented on this website, for example, note the variety of specific detailed points along the Maine coast that the Board of Trade received information about.  Similarly, note the multiplicity of distinct fishing villages about which the Commissinoners received information around the coast of Newfoundland. </p>

<p style="max-width: 70%;">To be clear, this information was not always descriptive – that’s not the point of this tool.  There is a methodological challenge related to the ways in which correspondents referred to geographic places - maybe in an oblique reference, or a quick mention in a longer list of places, or a detailed description. So whereas in one letter from Maine, the lieutenant governor of New Hampshire, David Dunbar, offered a relational account of where several settlements he had started were compared to each other [see text at CSPC v. 38, no. 217], in the Newfoundland case, the newly arrived governor reported to the Board on the places he’d visited in May [CSPC 38/333], then in July he sent back a series of documents detailing events in the various villages [CSPC 38/422].  The content of the letters shows that the Newfoundland governor was not writing specifically to convey geographic knowledge, and thus for this project I need to find a way to acknowledge the difference between the kinds of references that people are making to geographic locations.  However, in spite of these distinctions, even the Newfoundland example, in which the letter-writer is not directly describing geography, is reflective of the mental geography of the members of the Board of Trade and other British officials involved in collecting and reading these letters.  The letter-writers would have made these mentions expecting that they could be understood, and even if the Commissioners on the Board would have had to pull out a map of Newfoundland to understand what the governor was talking about, those points reflected geographic knowledge that was somehow a part of how they envisioned the British Atlantic.</p>

<p style="max-width: 70%;">The Board of Trade’s vision of empire emerged in the dynamic between broad geographic conceptions (small scale) and detailed understandings of particular spots on the map that could, at a particular moment, be quite strategically valuable or important to Britain’s goals of settlement, improvement, profit, or sovereignty (large scale).  Combining the two produced the model for an expansive and uniquely British empire in the Atlantic.  This project attempts to visualize that model which existed in the minds of eighteenth-century British bureaucrats overseeing the Atlantic.</p>
