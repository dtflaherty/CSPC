        Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Since I 
        had the honour of writing you last I have met the Assembly 
        of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">this Province</placeName> and after recommending to them what I thought 
        needfull for H.M. honour and service, and their own good, and 
        in a more especial manner pressing upon them H.M. 27th 
        Instruction for fixing a salary on me and my successor I waited 
        on them in a session of eighteen dayes, and finding they wou'd         
        come to no amendments on the bill they had past before, I 
        dissolv'd them, and inclose your Grace a Journal of the pro- 
        ceedings at this short session. I have issu'd writts for a new 
        Assembly to meet the 10th of next mo. and hope there will be a 
        change in the Assembly for the better advancing H.M. honour 
        and service, and nothing in my power shall be wanting towards 
        it. But should it be otherwise I think I have done but my 
        duty in dissolving the late Assembly since they would come 
        no nearer to the King's Instruction, etc. Repeats recommendation 
        of Mr. Sherburn for Lt. Gov. of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="descriptive">N.H.</placeName> v. Dec. 15, 1730. On 
        24th Dec. received Additional Instruction of Sept. 26th for the 
        better preservation of H.M. woods and issued Proclamations 
        in both Provinces accordingly. Continues : This day I receiv'd 
        from Col. Dunbar H.M. Order in Council, 12th Nov., mentioning 
        a representation that I was preparing a military expedition 
        against <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's fort</placeName> etc. Continues : In this representation 
        my Lord Duke there is not the shadow of truth, nor did I ever 
        make the least attempt or preparation of that nature. Yet I 
        am not at all surpriz'd that Col. Dunbar had the folly, and 
        confidence as well as malice to make such a representation 
        against me. Because I am lately told he has wrote many other 
        palpable falshoods to do me all the hurt in his power, but if he 
        would confine himself to truth I should not give myself any 
        trouble about him : the ship by which this goes sails in the 
        morning, that I shall not be able to send your Grace the necessary 
        papers of a notorious riott committed by some people belonging 
        to Frederick's fort on some of H.M. subjects of this Province, 
        as also what I directed H.M. Lt. Govr. of this Province to 
        do at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> upon a visitation I order'd him to make to all 
        the fortifications of this Province. Another ship will sail in a 
        few dayes by which I shall send these things for my justification, 
        and which I believe will be to the intire satisfaction of H.M. 
        and his Ministers, and convince your Grace with what injustice 
        this gentleman has treated me. If he intends to take upon 
        him the office of an informer upon all my actions, and then to 
        present them in a false light, it will be giving your Grace and the 
        rest of H.M. Ministers a vast deal of unnecessary trouble. I 
        should be glad when he seeks to make any complaints against 
        me for the future that he would serve me with a copy before 
        he sends them away, then my answer might go in the same 
        ship, and had he done so now, I presume there had been no 
        occasion for H.M. order to me of 12th Nov., the matter on which 
        it is founded being absolutely false. I ask pardon for giving 
        your Grace so great an interruption from the vast affairs of 
        Europe, that ingross your precious hours etc. Signed, J. Belcher.

        <p>Copy of proceedings of the General Court of the 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, Sept., Oct., 1730, relating to a 
          riot at <placeName ref="us_me_newharbor" role="direct">New Harbour</placeName>, near Pemaquid, in York County,
          upon the complaint of Josiah Grover against some 
          Irish settlers, who seized him and his fishing schooner 
          and company when he went to clear and settle some 
          land there purchased by his ancestor, John Brown, 
          from the Indians 15th July, 1625. He escaped to 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName> and complains to the Governor, who instructed 
          the Justices of <placeName ref="#us_me_york" role="descriptive">York Town</placeName> to enquire into the matter. 
          Four Irishmen were apprehended at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> by the 
          Sheriff and committed for trial at the next General 
          Sessions. They acknowledged that they assisted in 
          seizing Grover's schooner, and said that they had orders 
          to do so from Alexander Hamilton, Captain of the 
          Fort. When the Sheriff came near Pemaquid, he 
          saw the colours flying at the fort, and being informed 
          by some Irish people that they designed to resist him, 
          he sent a message to the officer there that he came 
          with authority to apprehend some criminals etc. and 
          required his assistance, who answered that he would 
          keep his fort and did not admit the Sheriff etc. The 
          guns were loaded, but the messenger warned the officer 
          that if he went on, they would every one be hanged. 
          Upon which Hamilton said he would take advice with 
          his Council, and went out of the fort, and the Sheriff 
          entered without opposition etc. Copy. 11 pp. </p>

        <p>Queries by Governor Osborn. To desier the opinion

          Col. Dunbar to Mr. Popple. Refers to former letters. 
          Continues : As to my disputes with the New Engld. people 
          I hope I shall be justifyed ; if ever any body was among them 
          without disputes, I will own myself in the fault and submit to 
          be sacrificed to their resentment ; since their Committee was 
          at <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Fredericksfort</placeName> I have been threatened with many actions 
          of trespass, and even high treason for building a fort and hoisting 
          the King's colours, wch. they themselves prostitute at their 
          little pallisadoed truck houses to exchange rum, molasses, and 
          tobacco etc. with the Indians ; I landed here the 10th instant 
          haveing been 12 days in my passage from Fredericksfort ; I 
          was in great danger by islands of ice in the <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="direct">river of Kennebeck</placeName>, 
          but I was obliged to go into that river to stop some saw mills 
          there who were destroying a fine swamp of pine trees near ye 
          water upon lands wch. I have reserved for the Royal Navy in 
          case the Proprietors or claimts. are disallow'd by H.M. etc. I 
          could not avoyd makeing some appointments of lands within 
          10 miles of the fort, where people are clearing ye woods, and 
          converting the timber, wch. is oak, birch, ash, maple and 
          popple, to ship timber, cord wood, and for pottash, and in order 
          to plant corn, garden seeds, hemp and flax in the spring, if I 
          had not done so, of course all would have dispersed, and would 
          never be induced to return, so that <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> would boast 
          of a victory, than which nothing could be a greater mortification 
          to me ; I have not presumed to make any grant, or exercise 
          any sort of jurisdiction, tho' many applications have been 
          frequently made to me in small cases, as a Governour or 
          Majestrate ; I dare not have refused hearing ye partys, then 
          gave my opinion, complaining it was hard upon me, haveing 
          no assistce. to be troubled with little disputes, and desired they 
          might either defer matters or agree among themselves until 
          majestrates could be appointed, and thus I have satisfied the 
          people, and kept them together, but if after all, they must quit 
          and loose their labour, many familys will be undone, and I 
          the unhappy occasion of their misery, as I am at this time of 
          my own ruine and my familys by my zeal and perseverance to 
          promote this settlement, because I am convinced beyond all 
          doubt that it will be very considerable and satisfactory to H.M. ; 
          I send to my Lords Commissioners a smal parcel of hemp and 
          flax, the produce of new ground at Fredericksfort of this year 
          and from New England seed, the seed wch. I had from <placeName ref="#pl_danzig" role="indirect">Dantzick</placeName> 
          by way of <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName>, being treacherously kept concealed until 
          the season was over ; I wish I had a fund to send for some of 
          each this year, and for two or more potash makers to <placeName ref="#pl" role="indirect">Poland</placeName> 
          or <placeName ref="#ru" role="indirect">Russia</placeName>.
          I think I could promise to serve <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> with 
          those commoditys in return for their manufacturys without 
          bringing away any of their mony, it is seldome any poor man's 
          scheme is worth anything, however hints may be usefull to 
          great ones ; I ought to be sufficiently discouraged as no notice 
          is ever taken from any of the Offices of my letters, yet I live in 
          hopes, wch. onely supports my spirits. These small samples 
          of hemp and flax, are not in such perfection as they would be 
          had I been at the place in time ; ye person I chiefly depended 
          upon to pull and dress them went away being discouraged by 
          common reports, an Irishwoman pulled, water-rotted and 
          dressed the flax, and the hemp was in the grownd when I arrived 
          there in the end of October, so that it was dew-rotted and even 
          frozen as it stood, the man who dressed it as you see it, has 
          made ropes and geer for cattle and carriages of some of it, and 
          assures me it is very strong, and undertakes to make it of as 
          fine a colour as flax next year, he tells me ye hemp here will 
          be finer than any European and has a good deal of the soft 
          nature of flax etc. From Kennebeck I went to <placeName ref="#us_me_portland" role="direct">Casco</placeName>, where 
          there is onely one loading of masts provideing this year, the 
          rest being contracted for at <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="direct">Piscatua</placeName>, wch. I am glad of in 
          respect to the Province of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> who are generally 
          a loyal good sort of people ; I went to ye undertakers house for 
          ye contract, and shewed him the orders I reed, to prevent 
          logging, he insisted on his right not to be interrupted, and 
          alleddged that he logged on his own private property etc. Refers 
          to enclosed letters which passed between them. Continues : Near 
          his house wch. is built in the woods and upon grownd cleared 
          within three years past, are five new mills each saw can cut 5 
          and sometimes 6000 feet of pine boards in 24 hours, he told me 
          if I sho'd stop his mills it would be ten pounds pr. diem damage ; 
          the lands about Casco are generally called private property, 
          and not one owner of a mill there but was pleased with the easy 
          proposal I made them to prove their property. I hope I am 
          not blameable for this condescention, and besides I am of 
          opinion yt. few or none of them will be deemed good ; some 
          shewed me their titles wch. were patents passed by Sir Edmd. 
          Andros in 1688, wherein are reserves of wheat and mony to 
          the Crown as an annual quit-rent, when I took notice of those 
          reservations, and sayd I would acquaint H.M. therewith, they 
          then disdained those titles, and sayd they did not esteem them, 
          for that they had some old titles from Sir Ferdinando Gorge 
          and Indian deeds ; I asked why they would produce Sir Edmond 
          Andros's pats, to me, they replyed because they seemed best to 
          the eye, but that it was an imposition of his to extort mony 
          from the people. Upon enquiry I find there are very many of 
          those patents, and all register'd, and if no quit-rent has been 
          received since, wch. is payable to H.M. or His Capt. Genll, of 
          the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Masachusets</placeName>, it will amount to a considerable sum, and 
          may easily be recovered after a reform in this Governmt., wch. 
          I hope is now upon the anvil. What I am now speaking of is 
          in the large county of York, formerly called the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">Province of Maine</placeName>,
          90 miles along the sea coast and backwards to ye <placeName ref="#pacific" role="boundary">South Sea</placeName>
          in the original grant ; My Lords Commrs. may think 
          that country is settled and peopled, whereas 20 miles in length 
          and halfe so much in width would be sufficient for them ; there 
          is yet onely one line of towns layd out there and they extend 
          all along the shore and onely eight miles backwards into the 
          country, thus many many millions of acres lye wast, whilst 
          these gentry are opposeing H.M. to make other parts usefull 
          to the Crowne ; if such matters are not represented home, no 
          remedy can ever be applyed ; this country not content with all 
          this ; do claim most part of <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>; it is this stragling 
          manner of settlement has (with their natural ill treatment of 
          all persons) allways exposed them to the insults of the Indians, 
          which (besides many poor souls cutt off), has cost them a great 
          many thousand pounds, and all might have been prevented by 
          gentle usage and some small present yearly to the poor natives, 
          who, unprovoked, seem a good natured people ; I herewith 
          send you a complaint from a Jesuit at one of their tribes 
          settlemt., to whom I wrote in English hearing he was an Irish 
          or Scotchman ; I hope by his influence to secure the friendship 
          of his tribe. Acknowledges receipt of H.M. Additional 
          Instruction for giving his share of the penalties upon loggers 
          to informers. Will endeavour to prevent any abuse of that 
          indulgence etc. Continues : I likewise received (Sunday, 10th 
          Jan.) an office pacquet for Governour Belcher, with which I 
          went to wait upon him, and he being ingaged at dutys (as they 
          call them) I sent it by a gentleman on Monday morning, and 
          wrote to him that some reasons to which he was no stranger 
          prevented my waiting upon him, one of wch. was, the threats 
          of the mobb etc. Encloses his answer, (encl. i). Continues : 
          It is wonderfull how this great man and generally his country- 
          men can act and say, and deny both. His behaviour and useage 
          of me is beyond my imagination, and tho' to my face he denyed 
          many things, I could prove them by many wittnesses, his last 
          stroke is most provokeing of all, he has given out here that I 
          was a spy in <placeName ref ="#es" role="indirect">Spain</placeName> and was so here now upon him and the 
          country. I hope as he is not comeatable here my Lords will 
          think I ought to have some satisfaction for so gross an abuse, 
          one consequence of it had likely to have fallen lately upon 
          Capt. Protheroe, Commander of ye Station ship, who walking 
          in ye street, a man enquired of another who he was, answer 
          was made, Collo. Dunbar, whereupon one replyed God d n 
          him lett us mobb him, but being undeceived, the Capt. escaped ; 
          I came onely hither to attend the Courts upon account of the 
          expences I was unawares drawn into last year at Fredericks-fort,
          and here mett the additional trouble of the return of 500/. 
          sterl. bills drawn by me on my groweing sallary wch. are pro- 
          tested. I intend in a few days to New Hampshire and into the 
          woods, and to send one of my Deputys to remain at Casco. 
          You no doubt have all the proceedings of this Great and General 
          Court transmitted by his Excy. to my Lords, no Governour 
          was ever more hated than he, and notwithstanding any assure- 
          ances he may give to the Ministry of succeeding in getting a 
          fixed sallary from the new Assembly, everybody tells me it 
          never will be given to him, and his pretences are onely to spin 
          out time, and keep the affair out of Parliament. I am even 
          told that the country have soe great an abhorrence of him for 
          betraying them (as they call it) that many of the first rank 
          are upon an Address to H.M. to give them any other Governr. 
          and they will comply with the Instructn. His chief Councilour 
          and favourite is the famous incendiary Dr. Cook, whose character 
          is known at home, and both the Govr. and Doctor irreconcileable 
          enemys to ye Dudley family who are reputed ye chiefs 
          of this country ; they were allways for the sallary and the 
          favourite Cook ever against it, wch. seems unaccountable that 
          a Governour is in earnest, and caresses the man, who is at 
          the head of his opposers. My Lords have heard of Govr. 
          Wentworth's death of New Hampshire, he was a worthy honest 
          gentleman, and is much lamented by the country, it is worth 
          nothing to be Leiut. Governour, who has no sallary but 200£. 
          this country mony, which all chief Governours before Mr. 
          Belcher gave out of their 200£. sterl., and he would not give a 
          shilling, nor is that small province able to give any ; they are 
          apprehensive that Mr. Belcher has recommended one Mr. 
          Waldron to be Lt. Govr., who was Clerk to the Council, 
          and is so now and yet is made a Councillour and a Judge by Mr. 
          Belcher, who has made great changes there, heavy upon gentle- 
          men who were putt in by Mr. Shute and Mr. Burnet for their 
          dutyfull and cheerfull complyance wth. ye Royal instructions. 
          Mr. George Jaffrey is one of them, he is of the Council, was one 
          of the Judges, and Treasurer of the Province, and Vice- judge 
          of the Admiralty, he is a man of good sense, fortune and figure, 
          and much the fittest to command that Province, I believe he 
          would accept of it, tho' I really do not know, but this I am sure 
          that no man there is more disaggreable to the King's friends than 
          Mr. Waldron. I was exceedingly surprised upon my arrival 
          here two days agoe to hear that Govr. Belcher had closetted 
          Mr. Auchmuty the Advocate General and prevailed upon him 
          to give a strange turn and construction to the conference he was 
          wittness to, wch. I gave my Lords an account of by my brother. 
          I taxed the Advocate Genll, with it who swore to me it was 
          false, and that he omitted nothing but the Governour's telling 
          me of sending down 500 men to dismantle the fort and take 
          the people prisoners, he promised to send me a copy of what 
          he gave Mr. Belcher, and to add that circumstance to it, wch. 
          he sayd had escaped his memory, but I rather take it he did it 
          out of complemt. to His Excellency. Mr. Auchmuty has told 
          ye story as I related it to my Lords Commrs., in twenty 
          places in this town etc. Continues : I am informed that many 
          heads here are now at work plodding against me. I defye all 
          the world whilst they stick to truth, but they would do anything 
          to have me removed etc. I am this moment told that there is 
          a Council sitting upon the report of the tryal of the four poor 
          men, brought from near Fredericksfort by order of this General 
          Court fr. the High Sheriffe of the county of York in October 
          last, it is sayd they are convicted but I am not able to learn for 
          what crime etc. I told you formerly they had onely stoped a 
          sloop from taking away some staves cutt by themselves. The 
          Governour wanted to try them for piracy. Pray Sir, Lay this 
          before my Lords etc. Signed, David Dunbar. Endorsed, Recd.

        " You desire me to shew you and your workmen

        wood be an imployment for us all and of course neglect

        Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and Plantations. Repeats gists of
        covering letter, Jan. 11th, and refers to those enclosures. Adds : These things, my Lords, 
        are the whole of what I have ever done respecting <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's 
        Fort</placeName> etc., and how was it possible for me to do less ? I inclose 
        your Lordships a memorial I deliver'd into H.M. Secretary of 
        State the 15th May last, in answer to which I should have been 
        very glad of some orders or directions for my conduct, but never 
        receiv'd a word of answer till his Majesty's order in Council of 
        12th Novr. last. According to the clause of the Charter cited 
        in my memorial these lands My Lords are doubtless a part of 
        this Province, and agreeable thereto your Lordships will find 
        in H.M. Commission to me these words, " And the lands lying 
        between the said territory of <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="indirect">Nova Scotia</placeName>, and the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="indirect">Province of 
        Main</placeName>." Quotes Commission to show that it makes the Charter 
        " the great rule of my Government " etc. Continues : How 
        dare I then disobey H.M. or betray the trust he has repos'd 
        in me by refusing a legal protection to his good subjects, when 
        they apply to me. These rioters, My Lords, have been since 
        legally convicted in H.M. Courts, and must doubtless undergo 
        the penalties of the law for such a breach of H.M. peace, and so 
        notorious an assault and riott committed upon the property, 
        and liberty of H.M. good subjects. I am here, my Lords, H.M. 
        Govr. to see a good execution of all his wholsome laws for 
        the safety of his subjects under my care in their lives and 
        estates, and to this end I will endeavour carefully to use the 
        power the King has delegated to me in his Royal Commission 
        etc. Continues : It is false in Col. Dunbar to say, No private 
        persons have hitherto set up any claim on those lands, because 
        there have been a great many claims made, and are made daily, 
        and the people that claim think they have a just right (tho' 
        not by any grant of this Province) and one of the men whom 
        Coll. Dunbar's people riotted and assaulted has a claim there 
        descended down to him for 105 years past as may be seen in 
        his complaint against these notorious riotters. My Lords, 
        every man's private property is his life, and I can't answer for 
        people's giving away what they think their own. But for the 
        right of this government to those lands according to the Royal 
        Charter. Had Coll. Dunbar wisely manag'd about 'em I think 
        I should have had influence enough with this Assembly to have 
        made a cession of their right to the Crown : and it was always 
        my opinion that it wou'd be greatly to the advantage of this 
        Province, that the Crown should settle those lands. Yet etc. 
        I know not how to answer those that say, The Crown has always 
        supposed these lands to be a part of this Province, or why have 
        the Govrs. of the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="indirect">Massachussetts</placeName> been ordered from time 
        to time to insist with the Assemblies to rebuild the Fort at 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName>. They say why have not the Governours of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">New 
        Hampshire</placeName> and Nova Scotia had those Instructions, and again 
        the King has directed the choice of a Councellour in the Royal 
        Charter to be chosen on account of those lands, and who of 
        course becomes one of the Legislators of H.M. Province of the 
        Massachusetts Bay, and without such a Councellour the present 
        Constitution cannot subsist. My Lords, I should be glad, I 
        say, to be instructed how to answer these things etc. Concludes : 
        I am tired of writing as I fear your Lordships will be of 
        reading, yet I must not be so vilely traduc'd and not answer 
        for myself ; I am an honest man, and hope ever to appear so. 
        Nor cou'd I possibly have done more from my arrival to this 
        day, than I have, in support of H.M. Dominions as well as for the 
        welfare of the Provinces under my care etc. Signed, J. Belcher.

        Proposes the construction of roads, every inhabitant 
        supplying his every sixth negro for that purpose etc. 
        The rebel negroes would then have to surrender, and, 
        amounting to 10,000 could be sold at 201. a head to 
        pay expences and for maintaining forts etc. The 
        mountainous woods at present occupied by the negroes 
        or unoccupied would then supply abundance of game 
        and provisions. Also it is well known there have been 
        veins of gold and silver ore found in the blew moun-

        <p>Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Refers 
          to letter of 11th Jan. Continues : My worthy friend and 
          agent Mr. John Caswall will deliver this into your Grace's hands, 
          to whom I have sent all the papers referr'd to in my last to be 
          deliver'd to your Grace, wheh you'll please to order him to 
          attend you with them etc. (v 11th Jan.). Continues : These 
          things are the whole of what I have ever done respecting 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's Fort</placeName>etc. Continues : 
          You'll find among these papers the copy of a memorial I made to the King and deliver'd 
          into your Grace's hands when I had the honour to take leave 
          of your Grace at <placeName ref="en_lon_newcastle" role="secondary">Newcastle House</placeName>, 15 May last, to which I should 
          have been glad of an answer. But never reciev'd one word 
          till H.M. order of 12th Nov. last came to my hands. In that 
          Memorial your Grace will find cited a clause of the Royal Charter 
          of this Province, making the lands at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> a part of this 
          Province, and agreeable thereto they are contain'd in H.M. 
          royal commission to me for this Government. Quotes from 
          Commission directing him to act according to the Charter. 
          Continues : How dare I then disobey H.M. etc. by refusing a 
          legal protection to his good subjects when they apply to me for 
          it. These riotters have been since legally convicted in H.M. 
          Courts, and must doubtless undergo the penalties of the law 
          for the breach of H.M. peace, and so notorious an assault and 
          riott etc. As H.M. Governor he will see a good execution of 
          his laws etc. Continues : Nothing can appear more false than 
          Collo. Dunbar's saying I was preparing a military expedition 
          against Frederick's Fort etc., nor did anything like it ever enter 
          into my thoughts. It is also false in him to say no private 
          persons have hitherto set up any claim to those lands, because 
          there have been a great many claims made and are made daily, 
          and the people that claim think they have a just right (tho' 
          not by any grant of this Province) and one of the men whom 
          Collo. Dunbar's people riotted and assaulted has a claim there 
          descended down to him for 105 years etc. v. 11th Jan. [encl. i]. 
          Continues : Every man's property is his life, and I can't answer 
          for people's giving away what they think their own, but for the 
          right of this Government to those lands according to the Royal 
          Charter. Had Collo. Dunbar wisely manag'd about them I 
          think I should have had influence enough with this Assembly 
          to have made a cession of their right to the Crown, and it was 
          always my opinion that it would be greatly to the advantage 
          of this Province, that the Crown should settle those lands. Yet 
          etc., I know not how to answer those that say, the Crown has 
          always supposed those lands to be a part of this Province, or 
          why have the Governours of the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts</placeName> been ordered 
          from time to time to insist with the Assemblies to rebuild the 
          fort at Pemaquid, they say, why have not the Governours of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">New Hampshire</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="indirect">Nova Scotia</placeName> had those Instructions, and 
          again the King has directed the choice of a Councellour in the 
          Royal Charter to be chosen, on account of those lands, and who 
          of course becomes one of the legislators of H.M. Province of the 
          Massachusetts Bay, and without such a Councellour the present 
          Constitution cannot subsist. My Lord Duke, I should be glad 
          I say to be instructed how to answer these things. But that 
          Gentleman has made himself so obnoxious to this countrey in 
          general, that I can attempt nothing with hopes of success, 
          where he has any concern. I humbly beg of your Grace, that 
          at no time any complaint may take effect to my prejudice till 
          I have time to make answer thereto for as it is the undoubted 
          right of the meanest Englishman to be heard upon any accusa- 
          tion, much more must it be the right of the King's Govr. whom 
          H.M. in his royal Instructions is pleas'd to call the representative 
          of his own person here. And I think Collo. Dunbar ought to 
          observe a decency to a Gentleman who has the honour to bear 
          so great a Commission from the King, yet I shall in my next 
          show to your Grace how rude he has been on this head. I 
          believe a short time will discover how little prudence he has, 
          and consequently of how little service he can be to the Crown, 
          in bringing forward the designed settlements. I hope always 
          My Lord Duke, to maintain the character of an honest man, 
          and I must assure your Grace it has been impossible for me to 
          do more from my arrival to this day, than I have in support of 
          H.M. honour and dignity, and for the interest of his British 
          Dominions, as well as for the Provinces under my care etc.

          Governor Worsley to the Council of Plantations.
          Encloses following : Is not able to send the Treasurer's account 
          of the 2s. Qd. levy of 1730, he not having made up his account 
          which does not end till the 19th instant. Continues : Your 
          Lordships will observe in my Speech to the Council and Assembly 
          I gave them a hint of finding some expedient at this present 
          juncture in relation to the payment of the arrears due to H.M. 
          upon the 2s. Qd. levy, what I have mentioned to some particular 
          Gentlemen is that they would pass a bill in the preamble of 
          which they might make their submission to H.M. on account 
          of their past faults, and to oblige those persons to pay their 
          levy for the two last years who have not done it, and to have 
          prayed H.M. to remit the fines and forfeitures that have been 
          incurred. Tho I could not nor did not propose to pass such a 
          bill yet I could have transmitted it home for H.M. most gracious 
          commands thereon, and if H.M. would have been pleased to 
          have remitted the fines and forfeitures and to have allowed me 
          to pass it, I believe it would have made the whole island easy 
          tho' most of the Assembly as I am told are convinced that what 
          they have done is erroneous yet dare not make use of this 
          expedient for fear of the people, who would then see they have 
          been deluded ; unless they were ordered so to do, however they 
          are so unaccountable in their conduct that I can be certain of

        <p><placeName ref="#bb" role="from">Barbados</placeName>.
          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. As I have allways endeavour'd 
          to protect and countenance H.M. Patent Officers and their Deputies 
          in <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">this Island</placeName>, I am sorry I 
          should have any occasion of complaining to your Grace against 
          any one of them especially Messrs. Reynolds the Provost 
          Marshall whose Patent three years ago was struck at by the 
          complaints that were made to me against their Deputy by the 
          same party, that they are now endeavouring to serve, and had 
          I not then conducted it, as I did, perhaps it would not have been 
          in the Patentees power now to have acted as they of late have 
          by putting in such Deputys, as I apprehend cannot be for H.M. 
          service, in that they have been supported, and recommended 
          to them by those, who have opposed the payment of H.M. tax 
          here, and have said, as I am informed, they would have officers 
          of their own. Refers to enclosures. Continues : I find Capt. 
          Kennedy has discover'd in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, what I have a long time 
          suspected here ; the persons they have deputed, are Mr. George 
          Gascoigne and upon his death, or absence or disability of acting 
          Mr. Thomas Granger, who is at present Deputy Clerk of the 
          General Assembly, and therefore a most improper person for 
          that office. Mr. Gascoigne did not pay H.M. tax the year before 
          the last, as your Grace will see by authentick copys of the 
          Treasurer's account, enclosed, and the last year he did not give 
          in number of his negroes etc. Their design is to get all the 
          Deputy's to the Patent Officers, and I am told are now endeav- 
          ouring to prevail with Mr. Whitworth to appoint a Deputy 
          Secretary in the room of Mr. Webster. Upon the perusal of the 
          above-mentioned letters, your Grace will observe the artifices 
          that are made use of to make me uneasy in my Government. 
          Mr. Ashley's mandamus not being come according to his 
          expectation, and as he gave out it would, has much disappointed 
          the party who opposed the payment of H.M. tax, and I can't 
          help mentioning to your Grace that several Gentlemen upon 
          that occasion have said, that if mandamus's come to those who 
          oppose the paying H.M. tax, what must we do then. With 
          this your Grace will receive a list of those persons names, who 
          ought to have paid the 2s. Qd. levy the year 1729 but did not, 
          as also the late Treasurer's account for the said levy for the 
          same year, in which are particularly mentioned the names of 
          those persons of every parish, who did pay etc. Continues : 
          Whether Mr. Ashley has paid since, I cannot tell, in that the 
          present Treasurer has not made up the last year's account, but 
          if he has it is probably to avoid paying the penalty, because 
          Mr. Cornor one of the then Assembly-men for <placeName ref="#bb_stphilip" role="direct">St. Phillips parish</placeName>
          had returned him as a defaulter. H.M. Council here having 
          rejected the Assembly's bill appointing Messrs. Forster, and 
          Leheup their Agents, the Gentlemen of the Assembly and others 
          have agreed as I am informed to fix them their Agents, and by 
          voluntary contribution have raised the same sallary, as was 
          appointed by the said bill, and Mr. Peers their Speaker to 
          correspond with them and have left it to Mr. Leheup, that 
          whether he appears, or does not appear publicly, as one of their 
          Agents, as he shall judge it most for their interest, the Gentle- 
          men concerned will look on him, as one, and make their 
          acknowledgments accordingly to him. Concludes as preceding 
          first letter to Council of Trade. Signed, Henry Worsley. 7 pp. Enclosed, </p>

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. Since
          the sealing of a letter to your Grace this morning, I have received 
          an authentick copy of the Minutes of Assembly of yesterday, 
          tho' I must observe there was but twelve of the twenty-two 
          members present. What is mentioned in their second motion, 
          is in relation to a late election for a vestry for <placeName ref="#bb_stphilip" role="direct">St. Phillips parish</placeName>, 
          betwixt Mr. Weeks one of H.M. Council here, and Mr. Ashley 
          etc. (v. encl. i). Continues : The law of elections for Assembly- 
          men, and Vestrymen obliges all the voters to take the oaths 
          appointed to be taken instead of the oaths of Allegiance and 
          Supremacy. Mr. Ashley and Mr. Culpeper brought one 
          Coupman a Roman Catholick to vote, Mr. Weekes insisted upon 
          his taking all the present State oaths, Mr. Ashley affirmed that 
          by the law of elections he was obliged to take the oaths appointed 
          to be taken instead of the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy. 
          Mr. Weekes refused the said Coupman to vote, and Mr. Culpeper 
          another of the candidates of the same side with Mr. Ashley has 
          prefered a petition etc. (encl. i), which is to be heard in Council. 
          This law of election was made in Mr. Cox's presidentship, and 
          if the oaths, the voters are to take, do not extend to the 
          abjuration, and the test, the said oaths were appointed to let 
          in Roman Catholicks, and others to vote at the said elections. 
          The affidavit I have inclosed etc., will set this matter in its 
          true light etc. Signed, Henry Worsley. 3 pp. Enclosed,</p>

          Whilst he was at <placeName ref="#us_me_falmouth" role="direct">Falmouth</placeName> [[ed - CSPC errantly locates Falmouth in NH]],
          some of Col. Dunbar's men seized a sloop near <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemmaquid</placeName>
          (where Col. Dunbar was about making settlements), which
          was about to load some staves, and threatened to shoot

          to <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName> for justice.
          The Governor ordered the Justices of <placeName ref="#us_me_york" role="indirect">York</placeName>

          Capt. Waterhous to Mr. Popple. Encloses following answers.
          Continues : The Fishery at <placeName ref="#ca_ns_canso" role="direct">Canço</placeName> is manag'd after 
          a manner different from that practis'd in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName>;
          for, instead of boat-fishing, it's wholly carry'd on by imbarkations. 
          call'd scooners, who are on the banks, sometimes a fortnight, 
          more or less as winds and weather present, so that it's impossible 
          the fish can prove so good as those brought in every day, which 
          is done by boat fishing ; but that can't be expected till the 
          place is settled with proper inhabitants, that can tarry there 
          winter and summer, which at present, is otherwise, the <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> 
          people having most of the property : They come in the 
          spring, and about the beginning of September return to New 
          England again, leaving two or three hands in each property 
          till next spring to provide for the flake, which are in very good 
          order etc. The place is extensive and full of islands, which are 
          very commodious for the Fishery, but there are wanting fortifi- 
          cations to secure even those that are now on that employment,

        <p>Answers to preceding by Capt. Waterhous. 22nd
          Jan., 1730/1. (i, ii) The inhabitants are possess'd of 
          no stages, cook-rooms, or train-fats, their business 
          being wholly employed in curing fish, very little oil is made at
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns_canso" role="direct">Canço</placeName>. (iii) No aliens or strangers do 
          resort to <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>, or islands adjacent thereto to 
          take bait, trade, or fish on any account whatsoever in 
          those parts, (iv) The fishermen are wholy supplyed 
          from <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> with the manufactures of the 
          Kingdom, either by British ships trading to Canço 
          etc. or from <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName>. I cannot find that they 
          are supply 'd with anything from foreign countries, 
          except what the New-England-men bring for their 
          own subsistence, (v, vi) The wages for carrying on 
          the fishery at Canço alters, some going by shares, and 
          others by the season, but mostly by what they catch, 
          so that the industrious man gets most : they are 
          commonly paid by bill ; or take up necessaries they 
          have an immediate occasion for ; but the charge of 
          fitting out and maintaining a scooner is uncertain, the 
          men having half they catch, and the owner, who finds 
          ware, tare, salt and provisions, has the other half, 
          (vii) The fishermen have no employment for their 
          people, but wholly to catch fish, the shoremen curing 
          them. The fishing scooners commonly carry five men 
          each ; the fish they afford at a settled price, viz. this 
          year at 40s. p. quintal New England money. I must 
          observe to you, that no topmast vessel does catch fish 
          in those parts, for its morally impossible any vessels 
          but scooners can do on this coast. There was not one 
          top-mast vessel there this year, (viii) By the latter end 
          of September all the fishermen go to New England in 
          their scooners (perhaps two or three men left to look after 
          their houses and flakes), to provide for the next season, 
          (ix, x) No houses of the inhabitants interfere with the 
          Fishery, but all contiguous to themselves, their flakes 
          as nigh the water-side as possible, and so run up in 
          the country as far as they have hands to manage 
          them ; the length uncertain ; just as the nature of 
          the ground will allow ; every man being allotted his 
          proportion of ground pr. Governor Philips. Their 
          flakes are in very good order and room enough, (xi) 
          The British ships that come from <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> for a sack 
          at Canço are victuald from Britain, and some bring 
          provisions to sell to the fishermen, (xii) There is 
          no such thing as ships making their own cargoes of 
          fish, (xiii) Taverns or publick-houses in Canço about 
          11, which are contiguous to the garrison for the benefit 
          of the soldiers, (xiv) As to their remaining as servants 
          to the inhabitants, there is no such thing ; for the 
          Proprietors and scooners with their crews go home 
          about Sept. etc. v. Art. viii. (xv-xvii) No servants 
          are brought from England as is practis'd in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName>.
          As for thefts and disorders there are very few, 
          at least when I was there, considering 130 scooners, 
          whose crews make up 650 men. Some debauch'd 
          people must be expected among such a number. The 
          people left behind last year were about 50 exclusive 
          of garrison, and about the same this year, (xviii) The 
          New England men do steal away some of the seamen, 
          but when detected severely suffer for it ; but they 
          are now more cautious, because I made an order, and 
          declar'd I would make reprisals, which I did on one of 
          them, when one of our men deserted, (xix) I can 
          answer for this year, what fish has been ship'd will 
          turn out well (if they have not a bad passage), con- 
          sidering the bad season, not having a fish day above 
          once in three weeks, that is, a day for hardning the 
          fish for shipping. As for their taking care in well 
          curing the fish, there is no industry wanting when 
          opportunities offer ; for their whole dependance is 
          upon their goodness ; and it's my opinion the masters 
          are more in fault than the shore-men to take fish, when 
          they know they are not thoroughly cured, (but I have 
          endeavour'd to put things to rights this year) which, 
          in some measure, may have been the occasion of 
          former complaints from the merchants. I have made 
          an enquiry of the manner of curing the fish, which is 
          as follows, vizt., they allow 10 hogsheads of salt to 
          100 quintals of fish, which I think very sufficient ; for 
          if they allow more in the hot season they would be 
          salt-burn'd, which is a great loss : and as to fish caught 
          in the spring, they cannot be much prejudic'd, except 
          in colour, which can't be so bright as the Newfound- 
          land fish that are caught in boats ; for the scooners 
          are commonly out a fortnight or ten days, according 
          as winds and weather present : but in hot weather they 
          run hazard ; for then some fish will be salt-burn'd 
          when they are brought on shore ; and there is no help 
          for it, tho' it is the occasion of some turning out 
          refuge fish, which is a great loss to them. The whole 
          fishery is carry'd on by the New England people in 
          embarkations, call'd scooners, which are the only 
          vessels to fish on this coast, and indeed it's the only 
          way at present they not employing any boats, tho' 
          its an excellent place for boat-fishing ; but that can't 
          be expected till settlements are fix'd by people that 
          can remain there summer and winter, which, for want 
          of proper fortifications, is at present neglected, their 
          properties not being secured to them, (especially on 
          the main) in case of the Indians breaking with us, 
          which at present we are under no apprehensions of, 
          tho' they are a sullen and treacherous people and it's 
          possible, on their breaking, they may destroy the whole 
          Fishery. The garrison being pin'd up to defend them- 
          selves, the Indians may come with numbers of canoes 
          to the back of the Fishery, and do the mischief, not- 
          withstanding the garrison, by reason the garrison 
          must have boats to transport them from one island to 
          the other ; and their way of attacking is commonly 
          in the night, they knowing every inch of the land. 
          (xx) As to the number of French ships at <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="direct">Cape Breton</placeName>, 
          and on that coast, there are, this year, 50 sail ; some 
          years they have 70 sail. I can't find any Irish Papists 
          settled among the French, at least I have not heard 
          of any, they never appearing nigh our port, and 
          whenever I meet any of their boats, nigh Can9o, they 
          presently go off. (xxi) I can't find any of the officers 
          of the garrison at CanO concern'd, in the least, either 
          of themselves or others, in the Fishery, but the whole 
          carried on by the Proprietors, who have houses and 
          rooms, which they leave with two or three persons to 
          take care of in the winter, neither do they hire out the 
          soldiers to fish. Signed, Tho. Waterhouse. Endorsed

          Governor Hunter to the Duke of Newcastle. Venture 
          this by a Bristol ship which is to sail tomorrow morning and 
          it serves only to acquaint your Grace of the safe arrival of the 
          Enterprize Capt. Smith on the 18th of this month by whom I 
          had the honour of two of your Grace's letters of the 9th of Nov., 
          1730. On the 26th of last month the Adventure Lord Muskery 
          Capt. sailed from <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName> bound for 
          <placeName ref="#cu_havana" role="direct">Havana</placeName> where he is to 
          take on board that part of the treasure of the Genoesa which the 
          Spanish Capt. en second De la Hay now in prison at Havana had 
          carried off with him (in a sloop belonging to <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this island</placeName> which 
          was sent him to save the crew) and then to proceed for <placeName ref="#es_cadiz" role="indirect">Cadiz</placeName>; 
          but of this Rear Admiral Stewart by who's orders his Lordship 
          acts will give your Grace a more particular account. Encloses 
          account of the treasure (No. i) etc., " which I had this morning 
          from Mr. Stewart." Continues : On the first advice I reced. 
          of H.M. orders to send two regiments forthwith from <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">Gibraltar</placeName>
          for the defence of this his Island, which indeed wanted it much, 
          I by proclamation call'd the General Assembly to meet on the 
          21st of this month, being prorogued to a longer time. They 
          met, but not in a number to proceed to business, desired leave 
          to adjourn to Monday the 26th instant, which was granted them ; 
          I wish and am not without hopes that they may make suitable 
          returns for H.M. care of their safety at a time when it is apparent 
          that they are in no condition to take care of themselves. All 
          who have anything here to care for and no views of bettering 
          their fortunes by changes rejoyce with hearts full of gratitude 
          for this timely succour and protection when they least expected 
          it. Mr. Stewart sends the Tartar to cruize to the windward 
          with my orders to the Officer commanding the troops on board 
          the transports which will be in conformity with the advice of 
          Council (end. ii). I hope they bring tents with them ; I have 
          however sent orders to <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, to make preparation for 
          their reception by repairing the old and building new hutts and 
          barracks. A small party sent out from the leeward brought 
          in a negro woman prisoner who has informed as in the paper. 
          (No. iii). There can remain no doubt of their correspondence 
          with and encouragement from the Spaniards. And I am affraid 
          they have the same with and from some within. The paper 
          mark'd (No. iv) is the copy of a letter from Lehy at <placeName ref="#ie_dublin" role="direct">Dublin</placeName>
          brought to my hands by our Attorney General, having by 
          mistake been delivered to the Executor of Mr. Murray deceas'd 
          by reason of the resemblance of the names Morrogh and Murray. 
          The original I shall send by Capt. Smith, that your Grace, if 
          yo(u) think fitt, may be better inabled to inquire after and find 
          out the writer. Last Monday one Tuder who has the command 
          of the party now fitting out against the slaves in rebellion on 
          the North East of this island, and the fittest man for that 
          command, having behaved himself well on that service when 
          others fail'd, was arrested at <placeName ref="#jm_kingston" role="direct">Kingston</placeName> where his party were 
          rendezvous'd for a petty debt contrary to law being a freeholder, 
          and kill'd in the Marshall's house by a shott behind him, two 
          of his party kill'd and some wounded at the door by the 
          Marshall's men, who are all here now in goal, the Coroner's 
          inquest having found the fact willfull murder. Of this I shall 
          be more particular by Capt. Smith. No. v is a copy of the last 
          letter I reced. from the General of the gallions etc. I have 
          desired Mr. Stewart to keep the Enterprize here a few days that 
          I may be able by her to inform your Grace what measures 
          the Assembly shall enter or resolve upon for the accommodating 
          and providing for the two regiments etc. Signed, Ro. Hunter.

          Governor Hunter to Mr. Popple. On the 16th of this 
          month I received by the Hannibal their Lordships' letter of 
          Oct. 22nd. Tho' I gave my assent to an act repealing the 
          Protestant act, chiefly because of the objection against it at 
          that board ; yet I believe every friend to the King's Government 
          in <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this Island</placeName> are sensible of the obligations they ly under to 
          their Lordships' for recommending the first to his Royal appro- 
          bation. Their danger from Irish Papist avow'd or conceal'd 
          having been greater than they apprehended so, much need not 
          be said to perswade their Lordships to get this repealer dis- 
          approv'd. They may perhaps amend it by a subsequent. The 
          very Faction itself would be ashamed on this side to say that 
          I had or possibly could have any views of putting my son's 
          names in patents for land at <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="indirect">Port Antonio</placeName>, but that of 
          encouraging others to become settlers, and if I could have don 
          it without discouraging such, I would have long ago removed 
          the negros I have there, which I leave a sacrifice to that view, 
          and have offered these or any other lands thereabouts in my 
          power or the King's grant to any person who will settle there 
          with the same number of negros, and these lotts are in partner- 
          ship with Col. Nedham the best settler of new ground here, 
          and he well knows the truth of what I say. I am surpris'd 
          at what their Lordships write about the old Seal, it was seal'd 
          up in Council, put into a box together with the Acts of Assembly 
          etc. and sent on board of the Plymouth, Capt. Bridge, 10th May 
          last by one of the Marshals, who brought a receipt for the 
          same, but I can not account for or guess at the cause of the 
          miscarriage. I hope before this time it may be found out. 
          This goes by a British ship which sails to-morrow morning, so 
          that I have not time to write as I ought to their Lordships, 
          but by Capt. Smith of the Enterprise which will sail in a few 
          days and is kept here on purpose their Lordships will hear from

          please of this. Signed, Ro. Hunter. Endorsed, Recd. 19th

          postpone the payment of 150,000£. and 1730£. now out on a

          it to interfere with H.M. 22nd and 23rd Instructions to me : 
          But I promis'd to send the bill to your Grace, and to humbly

          to survey the forts and garrisons in the Eastern parts 
          of the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="indirect">Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, I embarked on board the

        <p>Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. Quote 
          from Governor Philipps' and Col. Dunbar's Instructions as to 
          laying out lands. Continue : But they having represented 
          to us, that, if they are obliged to follow the letter of these 
          Instructions, it would be a great discouragement to the settle- 
          ment of the Province, inasmuch as the finding out of proper 
          tracts of wood lands for the service of the Royal Navy would 
          require much time and consequently delay, if not disappoint, 
          the intention of such persons as may be at present disposed to 
          settle in <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>, more particularly great numbers of 
          Palatines and Irish Protestants, who are now willing and 
          desirous to become planters there ; we take leave humbly to 
          propose to your Majesty, in order to remove this obstacle, that 
          Colo. Dunbar may be impower'd, notwithstanding the said 
          Instructions, so soon as he shall have mark'd out any quantity
          of woodlands for the service of your Majesty's Royal Navy, 
          to set out an equal quantity of land not fit for that service 
          for such persons as shall be disposed to settle etc., always taking 
          care, that the lands, for the use of the Royal Navy, be first 
          mark'd out, and that those intended for private settlements 
          be on such lands only as are not fit for the service aforesaid ; 
          by which means the service of the Royal Navy will be 
          effectually provided for, and the settlement of this Province 
          may at the same time go forward etc. Propose to prepare 
          Instructions to them accordingly. [C.O. 218, 2. pp. 224-226.]</p>

          we do this purely out of regard to H.M. service, because we

          Lewis Bonnet to Mr. Delafaye. Warns him against 
          Mr. White, who has joined with Mr. Colebrooke to embarrass 
          the Governor for their own ends. Continues : Mr. Colebrooke 
          was chosen Speaker of the Assembly in which were several of 
          his creatures, so that by his artifice, and the ignorance of the 
          majority of the members, he carryed everything as he pleased, 
          and Mr. White being a great talker in the Council, most of 
          which were the old inhabitants and illeterate, they two consulted 
          their measures with the Assembly so as to be continually 
          pushing forward their own views, by which means they soon 
          began to lord it over the people in a very haughty and imperious 
          manner and to oppose the Governor in everything they could, 
          espetially in his designs of repairing the fortifications etc. 
          Mr. Colebrooke by his logick and sophistry, which the people 
          were very much unused to, prevented their coming to any 
          resolution about it, and Mr. White exerted himself to the same 
          purpose in the Council, which appearing very plain to the 
          Governor upon receiving a very extraordinary message from 
          the Assembly, he desired Mr. White and one Mr. Jenner another 
          tool of Mr. Colebrooke's to retire from the Council Board 
          into another room whilst he would acquaint the other 
          Gentlemen with something which he would not have them 
          enter into till it came to be debated in Council, they accordingly 
          withdrew and the Governor in a very little time sent for them 
          to take their seats, to enter on business, but Mr. White was 
          gone and hastened to acquaint the Speaker, Mr. Colebrooke 
          with this affair, and Mr. Jenner denyed to go in, saying Mr. 
          White was gone and he would go to etc. ut supra. Continues : 
          Upon this Mr. Colebrooke took upon him to harangue the 
          Members of the Assembly in a very extraordinary and seditious 
          manner, told them they were threatened with arbitrary power, 
          and bid them joyn with him and he would make an humble 
          address to H.M. that he would please to send them an honest 
          Governor who would act by law, and recall his tyrannical 
          and arbitrary Governor home, and amused the people with 
          speeches to this effect, and prevented their proceeding to do any 
          business till he had quite tired their patience, and the Governor 
          found it necessary to disolve them to lett the poor people go 
          about their private affairs since it was evident their Speaker 
          would divert them from doing the publick any service. As 
          soon as the Assembly was disolved, Mr. Colebrooke seized 
          upon all the books and papers thereof, and would not deliver 
          them to the Clerk, and afterwards denyed them to the Governor 
          in Council, who required them in order to send fair transcripts 
          home etc. Then Mr. Colebrooke applied himself to make a 
          party in the following Assembly, now sitting, and joyn'd himself 
          with the most ignorent of them in order to have a majority of 
          voices, and became reconciled to a man of whom he always 
          spoke with the utmost contempt, and who always represented 
          Mr. Colebrooke as one of the vilest of men, and the most 
          obnoxious to any civil Government, yett by giving him and 
          others large credit (out of the effects of some gentlemen at 
          home who intrusted him) and promises of more, he has got 
          them over to his side, and now he goes on very strenuously in 
          his old strain of opposing the fortifications being repaired, and 
          said publickly in the house at the first meeting of the present 
          Sessions that he always detested and abhorred the garrison etc. 
          Continues : The great opinion I have of the Governor's honour, and his constant endeavours 
          to promote the welfare of <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Colony</placeName>,
          and the very bad usage he has received from these two 
          persons who were both so much obliged to him, and Mr. White 
          being returning home on purpose to do him all the prejudice 
          he can, extorted this epistle from me etc. Signed, Lews.

          Governor Rogers to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. On the 11th Oct. last I had the honour to write
          your Lordships directly hence by Capt. Bankes, and sent a 
          duplicate of the same via <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName>. I have herewith by a direct 
          opportunity forwarded duplicates of the Acts of Assembly, 
          some of which I since have found are in some measure difficient
          through the ignorance of great part of our Assembly and artifice 
          of one person whom I had some confidence in or my first arrival 
          when the ill condition I found <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Colony</placeName> in did not allow me 
          time to weigh and deliberate on them with that circumspection 
          I intend for the future. During the sessions of the late Assembly 
          I endeavoured pursuant to H.M. Instructions to recommend 
          the state and condition of the fortifications, which much wanted 
          all the assistance possible for their repair etc. (v. 11th Oct. 1730). 
          I did not find the major part of the Assembly averse at first, 
          but since they have been diverted from their good intentions 
          by the insinuations of one Mr. Colebrooke, their Speaker, who 
          imposed so long on their ignorance, that I was obliged to disolve 
          them, lest his behaviour might influence them to fall into 
          schemes yet more contrary to the good of the colony and their 
          own safety. Another Assembly is lately elected and still find 
          the effects of the above Mr. Colebrooke's influence on the most 
          ignorant of them, who are the majority, and whom he has 
          possess'd with notions of their being subject to the garrison, 
          which he publickly declared in the House he always detested 
          and abhorred, stiling it an arbitrary power and what the[y] 
          ought to oppose, though I never heard any complaints against 
          the garrison since my arrival. And he also attempts to take 
          from the Officers, and such of the soldiers of H.M. Garrison as 
          are equally freeholders with the inhabitants the liberty of voting 
          in common with their fellow subjects, so that I perceive I am 
          to expect but little publick service from the resolves of the 
          present Assembly ; being mostly influenced by him to oppose 
          any support towards the work of the fortifications, in which 
          designs I found he was assisted by one Mr. White who was of 
          H.M. Council here, and an old acquaintance of Mr. Colebrooke's, 
          and acted in concert with him in his designs to the great prejudice 
          of this Government, in which I was enough confirmed by 
          messages from his accomplices in the Assembly opposing the 
          country's assistance towards the fortifications, for which reasons, 
          at a meeting, being willing to acquaint the rest of the Council 
          therewith, I, in the most friendly manner, desired him and one 
          Mr. Jenner (who followed the same measure and was a dependant 
          on Mr. Colebrooke) to retire into another room whilst I advised 
          with the other Gentlemen of the Council, telling them it was on 
          something I did not judge proper then to mention before them, 
          till I had discoursed the rest present who were for going on with 
          fortifications. This affair happening on our receiving an 
          extraordinary message from the Assembly relating thereto and 
          and after having conversed with five of the Board present 
          wch. did not take up a quarter of an hour's time, I sent to 
          desire Mr. White to joyn and make a board as usual, but found 
          he was gone to consult his friend the Speaker of the Assembly, 
          and upon his being duly summonded the next morning he 
          refused to attend, which he signified by a letter to that purpose, 
          whereupon having first taken the advice of the Council present 
          and believing it more for the quiet of the Colony that I should 
          suspend him without entring the reasons at that Board, which 
          on extraordinary occasions as I humbly presume this was, I 
          made use of H.M. permission according to my Instructions 
          till H.M. pleasure be further known, and suspended him from 
          acting as one of the Council till that time, leaving Mr. Jenner 
          to declare his intentions which he often has since and refused 
          to attend the Council, abiding by what he had wrote in concert 
          with Mr. White. I am not in a state of health nor have I time 
          by this conveyance to trouble your Lordships further on this 
          affair but shall by next conveyance which I depend will happen 
          very soon after this and hope to do it from Carolina. I have 
          published H.M. order of 25th Sept. etc., since when we have 
          lost two sloops from this port, one of which we hear is carried 
          into <placeName ref="#cu_havana" role="direct">the Havana</placeName>. I daily expect the masters will be here to 
          make regular complaints thereof as prescribed by H.M. said 
          orders. Two sixty gun ships with warlike stores are lately 
          arrived at the Havana and as I am informed by a vessel lately 
          arrived thence they have encreased the number of regular forces 
          in that city and garrison and that my Lord Muskerry in H.M.S. 
          Adventure lay there ready to sail in her passage from <placeName ref="#jm" role="indirect">Jamaica</placeName>
          to <placeName ref="#es_cadiz" role="indirect">Cadiz</placeName>, with the money aboard her which was saved out of the 
          rich Spanish wreck some time since lost near Jamaica. The 
          present ill state of my health which has been lately much 
          impaired obliges me to have recourse to H.M. permission of 
          going to South Carolina for change of air, from whence I hope 
          to return in three weeks or a month, and that one or two of H.M. 
          ships will accompany me thence in order to make a demand of 
          our vessels (taken by the Spaniards) pursuant to H.M. orders. 
          Mr. White etc. was some time Chief Justice in this Colony 
          appointed by me, in which he acted with partiality and I have 
          displaced him from that office. He comes home by this 
          opportunity and as he has misconstrued almost everything I 
          have endeavoured to doe for the publick service, I have reason 
          to believe he may also misrepresent my actions in some sort of 
          complaints from himself or others by his and Mr. Colebrooke's 
          instigations, which I cant here yet be apprised of ; and I entreat 
          your Lordships goodness that I may be allowed time to answer 
          to anything of that kind before it has made any impressions to 
          my disadvantage, having done everything here to the best of 
          my judgement for the service of the publick, and if I should 
          have inadvertently been guilty of any mistake, it has not been 
          thro' want of zeal for H.M. service and the welfare of this 
          Colony, in which I shall always act with that integrity that 
          becomes a man of honour deserving your Lordships patronage 
          and protection. Acknowledges Additional Instruction of 2nd

          Mr. Popple to Col. Dunbar. Acknowledges letters of 
          2nd and 25th May, 5th and 16th June, 19th Aug., 15th and 21st 
          Sept. and 21st Oct. Continues : My Lords Commissioners 
          would sooner have given me their directions in answer, but 
          that the great dispute, relating to the claim of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusets Bay</placeName> 
          and of several private Proprietors to lands in that part of 
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName> where you are, is not yet determin'd ; But as the 
          Sollicitor of the Treasury has with the approbation of My Lords 
          Commissioners for Trade and Plantations laid before the 
          Attorney and Sollicitor General a full state of this matter for 
          their opinion in point of law, who are now hearing Council on 
          both sides thereon, it will shortly receive a decision. In the 
          mean time you are at liberty to lay out lands as directed by your 
          Instructions between the rivers <placeName ref="#rv_penobscot" role="boundary">Penobscot</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#rv_stcroix" role="boundary">St. Croix</placeName> and 
          their Lordships wish you success in such settlements as you 
          shall make there : But until the King's title to the lands between 
          <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="boundary">Kennebeck</placeName> and Penobscot shall be finally determined, you are 
          not at liberty to make any settlements there. But as to those 
          which you have already made in the neighbourhood of <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName>, 
          you will perceive by the duplicate of an Order to the Governor 
          of <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> which was sent you some time ago, that H.M. 
          has been pleased to direct that they shall not be disturb'd till 
          his further pleasure shall be known. And if the right shall 
          appear upon enquiry, to be in H.M., we apprehend the people 
          you have settled there will never be disturb'd. All settlements 
          to be made at or near <placeName ref="#ca_ns_annapolis_royal" role="direct">Annapolis Royall</placeName>
          and Canço or in any other part to the N.E. of Santa Croix are left entirely to the 
          direction and care of Colo. Phillips and therefore you will have 
          nothing more to do there but lay out the lands pursuant to Colo. 
          Phillipps' directions, but this may be done by your Deputies 
          that you may have the more leisure to comply with the other 
          parts of your duty elsewhere etc. Although you are directed 
          by your Instructions to lay out another hundred thousand acres 
          of land between the Rivers Penobscot and St. Croix, yet you 
          are not confin'd to any particular place but may mark them out 
          according to the best of your judgement even in the different 
          parcels if necessary, always taking care not to incroach upon 
          private property, and my Lords do not doubt your integrity in 
          the execution of this trust, And whereas their Lordships have 
          observed by the copies of the letters between Col. Phillipps and 
          you which you transmitted to the Board relating to this part 
          of the execution of your trust, that great difficultys did occur 
          to Col. Phillipps in the peopling of Nova Scotia, in case such 
          persons as were desirous to take up lands there should be oblig'd 
          to wait till the whole three hundred thousand acres proposed to 
          be reserved for the service of the Royal Navy should have been 
          mark'd out and set apart by you for that use, their Lordships 
          have represented this matter to H.M. and expect shortly to 
          receive his directions thereon. " My Lords taking notice of the 
          discouragement which you apprehend it may be to the settling 
          of lands to the Eastward, that the title to those lands tho' layed 
          out by you may hereafter be lyable to dispute have commanded 
          me to direct you, that Col. Philipps is directed by his Instruc- 
          tions to affix the Great Seal of the Province of Nova 
          Scotia to all such allotments of land as you shall set out to the 
          westward of St. Croix, whereby the titles to such lands will 
          become indisputable, and when any number of allotments 
          shall be ready for the Great Seal they may be sent all together 
          to Col. Philipps for his confirmation. My Lords Commissioners 
          have commanded me to send you a copy of the petition which 
          Mr. Waldo has presented to the King in relation to such claims 
          as are set up against H.M. title to the land between the Rivers 
          Kennebeck and Penobscot that you may transmit to them what 
          informations you can upon that subject, tho the validity of 
          these claims may possibly be determined before this letter can 
          reach you. Their Lordships presume you have sent duplicates 
          to the Admiralty of those letters to me wherein you complain 
          of the difficulties you lye under of obtaining right in the Courts 
          of Admiralty in New England on seizures and condemnations 
          in behalf of the Crown ; However I have received orders to 
          transmit copies of your letters to the Admiralty, and my Lords 
          will readily concur with the Lords of the Admiralty in anything 
          that shall be proposed for redressing that grievance. My Lords 
          do not make you any particular answer to what you say in 
          relation to the settling the bounds between the Massachusets 
          Bay and <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, because the Governor of those 
          Provinces having received very full Instructions from H.M. 
          has already laid them before the Assembly of New Hampshire, 
          and we hope they may have a very good effect. It is with 
          great concern that My Lords Commissioners have read that 
          part of your letters wherein you mention the ill usuage you 
          have met with in the execution of your employment, and they 
          are sorry to find that you have put yourself to any expence 
          beyond what the duty of your office required of you, because 
          of the difficulty which must attend the application for repay- 
          ment, in a case where no fund is appointed for that purpose : 
          But if the money which you have expended for the publick 
          service shall really appear to have produced some advantage,
          My Lords are very willing to recommend the repayment thereof 
          to the Lords of the Treasury, and for the future it will be 
          prudent for you to be very cautious how you engage in any 
          expence beyond what you are directed to make. Upon this 
          occasion you particularly mention your expence in prosecutions 
          and your opinion that the Advocate and Attorney General 
          may be ordered to attend them to make their demands home, 
          and that the fines imposed might not only pay this charge but 
          afford some small salary or travelling charges for them. My 
          Lords take it for granted that it is the duty of all the King's 
          Officers to assist you in these prosecutions and would be willing 
          to propose the fines as a fund for this purpose had they not 
          upon your recommendation to the Lords of the Admiralty 
          prepared Instructions to the several Governors of the Colonies 
          which have since been approved of whereby the King's moiety 
          of all fines is given to the Informer. My Lords observe what 
          you have wrote concerning the construction which is put upon 
          those Acts of Parliament which impose fines upon offenders in the woods in 
          <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">America</placeName>, and for your information in this particular 
          I am commanded to send you a copy of Mr. Fane's opinion 
          whereby you will perceive that fines imposed by English Acts 
          of Parliament are deem'd to be and must be paid in sterling 
          mony. My Lords Commissioners are very sorry to find by your 
          letters that your health is so much impaired as to incline you 
          to think of resigning your employment, should you yet have the 
          same intention my Lords would very willingly at your request 
          propose your brother Mr. Jeremiah Dunbar for your successor ; 
          but as the nomination of this Officer is not in them you might 
          by this step run the risque of losing your employment and your 
          brother not succeed you : My Lords therefore hope your health 
          will return and that your dilligence and fidelity in the execution 
          of what you have now in charge may lay a foundation for 
          recommending you to a less painfull employment. My Lords 
          Commissioners having at your request transmitted to the 
          Lords of the Admiralty the proceedings of the Vice Admiralty Court at 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">Portsmouth</placeName> in the Province of New Hampshire, upon 
          an information exhibited by Arthur Slade, one of your Deputies 
          against Jeremiah Foolsom, for cutting ten white pine trees 
          without H.M. licence first had and obtained ; I am commanded 
          to inclose to you a copy of Dr. Sayer's opinion thereupon 
          whereby you will perceive that the person who prepared the 
          information against Foolsom laid the foundation for the decree 
          as it is pass'd, by admitting the said trees to have been cut 
          within the township of <placeName ref="#us_nh_exeter" role="direct">Exeter</placeName> which does not appear to have 
          been an offence within the Statute upon which the information 
          was grounded. You will therefore be more cautious for the 
          future in any prosecution upon the foot of this Act : But as 
          that pass'd in the second year of His present Majesty's reign 
          entitled an Act for better preservation of H.M. Woods in America 
          etc., is much more explicit, I am commanded to send you a copy 
          thereof for your better guidance in this particular. P.S. Since 
          the writing of this I have received and laid before my Lords 
          Commissioners your letter containing a narrative of your 
          proceedings from 17th Nov. 2nd Dec., which they will take 
          into consideration as soon as possible etc. [C.O. 218, 2. pp. 227-236.]</p>

          Governor Hunter to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. By this conveyance of the Enterprise, Capt. 
          Smith, Comr., I have the honour to acquaint your Lordships 
          that Capt. Dent arrived here on the 7th of this month with 
          four of the transports, the other two being arriv'd three days 
          before ; the officers are in good health etc. The Assembly now 
          sitting are come to some resolutions towards providing for them, 
          viz., that 20s. per week be paid to the commissioned officers and 
          5s. to private men after the provisions brought hither with them 
          are expended, for the Officers, from the day of their arrival here. 
          They have also resolv'd that 10£. pr. head be paid to officers and 
          soldiers for every rebel slave by them kill'd or taken alive and 
          are now preparing bills for the additional duty for one year 
          and a capitation of a shilling on slaves and three pence on cattle 
          for that expense besides the deficiency bill. I had before their 
          coming ordered all the houses that could be had at <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName>
          to be hired for their reception on their landing, but these upon 
          the view of their Quarter-Masters not being sufficient ; their 
          Officers thought it adviseable that they should continue on board 
          for a day or two till we could provide better, but hearing that 
          they began to sicken on board, I have ordered them to be landed 
          forthwith and what we cannot lodge at Port Royal to be sent 
          to <placeName ref="#jm_kingston" role="direct">Kingston</placeName> that we may discharge the transport.
          The Tartar was sent to cruize to windward with orders to the Officer commanding
          to detach six companys directly for <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName> 
          to save time and expense. They escaped him, I suppose in 
          the night and the cruizer is not yet return'd, but that number 
          shall be convey'd thither speedily, having on my first advice 
          ordered hutts and barracks to be built for them there, where 
          they are much wanted, the chief strength of the rebels being 
          near to that place. On the first of this month our Country 
          party fitted out for another attempt on these slaves set sail 
          from Port Royal for Port Antonio, under convoy, I have heard 
          nothing of them since, and expect little good from them, their 
          Commander of whom I had a very good opinion being arrested 
          contrary to law for a petty debt, and whilst in custody in the 
          Deputy Marshal's house barbarously murdered ; for which the 
          Marshal and his men are now in gaol in order for their trial next 
          Court. I am now very much busied in giving orders for the 
          repartition of the soldiers, it being judg'd by the Council, and 
          Assembly most for the service of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Island</placeName>  
          that they be barrack'd in several different parishes. I hope (by Capt. Dent 
          who is to sail in a short time) I shall be able to transmitt to your 
          Lordships the acts of this session etc. P.S. Capt. Brook who 
          had the command of the late party etc. (v. 24th Dec.), has been 
          mulct of his pay. Signed, Ro. Hunter. Endorsed, Reed. 19th,

          Lt. Governor Gooch to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Refers to account of negro conspiracy (v. 14th Sept., 1730). 
          Continues: Since which the negros, in the 
          countys of <placeName ref="#us_va_norfolk" role="direct">Norfolk</placeName> and
          <placeName ref="#us_va_princessanne" role="direct">Princess Anne</placeName>, had the boldness to 
          assemble on a Sunday while the people were at church, and to 
          chuse amongst themselves officers to command them in their 
          intended insurrection, which was to have been put in execution 
          very soon after : But this meeting being happily discovered 
          and many of them taken up and examined, the whole plot was 
          detected, for which the major part of them were severely 
          punished, and four of the ringleaders, on full evidence convicted, 
          have been executed. This, with the imprisonment and correction
          of some of the most suspected in the other parts 
          of the country, where the designs appeared not so far concerted, 
          have brought them now to be very quiet and submissive : But 
          as we cannot be too much on our guard against such desperate 
          combinations, I have ord'red the Militia to patrole twice or 
          thrice in a week to prevent all night meetings, and every man 
          to bring his arms to church on Sundays and Holydays, lest they 
          should be siezed by the slaves in their absence, if the same 
          mutinous spirit should be revived amongst them etc. By the 
          death of Colo. Page etc., there is a second vacancy at the Council 
          Board ; I hope the first is or will be speedily filled up by H.M. 
          appointment of Colo. Harrison whom I formerly recommended : 
          and I must heartily wish the second might be supplied by the 
          choice of Colo. Henry Armistead, a gentleman of a fair fortune 
          and character, and of the same county in which Colo. Page 
          lived ; and I am the more sollicitous for Mr. Armistead because that
          <placeName ref="#us_va_gloucester" role="direct">county of Glocester</placeName> is the most populous, 
          and where there are more negros than any other county in the Government, and 
          hath always had one sometimes more of the Council residing 
          in it, who had the direct command of the Militia, which in all 
          probability would not be very easie if put under the conduct 
          of another who had no estate or interest there. For these 
          reasons, as well as out of regard to the merit of Mr. Armistead 
          I humbly recommend him etc. But if Mr. Corbin's friends have 
          prevailed, and he is preferred to Colo. Harrison, or they still 
          insist on his being one of the Council, I must then intreat your 
          Lordships to interceed for Mr. Harrison in the place of Colo. 
          Page, postponing Mr. Armistead until another oppertunity ; 
          since the interest of the former in a frontier county, bordering 
          on the Indians, and where their impressions are generally directed, 
          may bring more advantage to the publick service, than the 
          inconveniency which may happen in the other county by Mr. 
          Armistead's present disapointment, if we must have Mr. Corbin. 
          I doubt not, my Lords, there are other persons here who on this 
          vacancy will endeavour (by some pretence or other, or by 
          forming of an interest among the merchants, perhaps a more 
          powerful application) to succeed Colo. Page. And I am appre- 
          hensive lest some posse[s]t with the ambition, whom I never 
          should have thought fit to insert in my list, do yet expect to 
          obtain it by an interest at home. But I beg your Lordships 
          will be pleased to allow some difference between a Governour's 
          personal knowledge and observation of the conduct and qualifi- 
          cation of men here on the spot, and the superficial knowledge 
          that can be attained by others, from an epistolary corres- 
          pondence ; or the judgment that can be framed of any person's 
          abilities in the Legislature of a country, and in dispensing of 
          Justice or the conducting affairs of Government, meerly from 
          the weight of his consignments. My Lords, the office of a judge 
          of the General Court, ought always to be considered in the choice 
          of a Councillor ; and it is the duty of a Governour to propose 
          none to be his assistants in the administration, but those whom 
          he knows zealous for H.M. service, and well disposed to promote 
          the publick good (especially now we are like to be under a new 
          law with respect to our trade, in which H.M. interest is so much 
          concerned) and admitting that he may sometimes be mistaken 
          in his men, it must be allowed strangers are more liable to be 
          imposed on ; and I cannot but lay it down as a principle founded 
          on reason and prudence, that in the choice of gentlemen for 
          publick offices, private affection ought not to be concerned, 
          unless there be sufficient ability and integrity in the person to 
          execute that trust, etc. Signed, William Gooch. Endorsed,

          injunctions in causes depending in Antigua, whilst he is resident 
          in any other island of his Government, notwithstanding the

          executed in a severe manner for the same, they 
          continue to meet in numbers in a most mutinous 
          manner, which the said merchants conceive to be with

        <p>Mr. Leheup to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          H.M. Lt. Governour in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> having directed me as Agent 
          for that Province to apply for H.M. royal confirmation of the 
          act for amending the staple of tobacco etc., offers answers to the 
          objections of the Commissioners of Customs etc. (v. 29th Dec., 
          1730). They were framed upon hearing one side only without 
          the Agent's being made acquainted with them till a copy of the 
          letter was sent to him signed, though he had applyed and 
          attended for that purpose etc. Repeats Lt. Governor Gooch's 
          arguments v. 23rd July, 1730. Replies he could not have any 
          other view in recommending this act than remedying the great 
          frauds in the tobacco trade etc. (i) As the Gentlemen of the 
          Assembly are planters, they are the best judges of the benefits 
          that will accrue to their trade from this law. The 3s. Virginia 
          money to be paid for inspecting and nailing the hhds. etc. is 
          a very small additional expence. Planters already pay 25. 
          or more for nailing and weighting. It was so far from being 
          intended to discourage the lower planters that the only act 
          that might affect them was repealed at the time of making 
          this, that of limiting the number of plants to be raised by each 
          tythable. (ii) Mr. Carkesse omits mentioning that the Crown 
          pays 1/2d. pr. lb. for all the bad tobacco burnt here. The Crown 
          will be saved this and the planter the freight etc. The bad sort 
          is so far from being most in request here, that the buyers here 
          will not give more than the duty for it, the consequence of which 
          is that the importer is obliged to send it abroad and then the 
          whole duty is drawn back and lost to the revenue, (iii) The 
          master is obliged by the Act of Parliament to swear to the 
          marks and number of hhds. on board, but they never swear 
          to the weight, which is most material to the revenue etc. The 
          Lt. Governor thought he had done eminent service to the 
          revenue in passing this act. It is continued only for three years, 
          in which time the advantage from it will manifestly appear. 
          Prays the Board to recommend it for confirmation etc. Signed,

        <p>Lt. Governor Gooch to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Having last night received a copy of a report 
          transmitted to your Lordships from the Commissioners of H.M. 
          Customs etc. (v. 29th Dec. 1730). I am greatly surprised to 
          find that Board influenced by the misinformations of persons, 
          who either know nothing of the tobacco trade, or wilfully 
          misrepresent it etc. Offers some remarks on their report, which 
          will convince all indifferent judges, that this act for amending 
          the staple of tobacco will really increase H.M. revenue. Answer 
          to 29th Dec., 1730. (i) Almost all the tobacco made by 
          the common people, (and they make the best), is sold to the 
          merchants in this country and the factors from the out-ports, 
          for cloathing and other necessaries which the planters want etc. 
          Their manner of dealing hitherto hath been that if a planter 
          wants but a pair of shoes at one of these stores, he must lay 
          out a whole hogshead of tobacco, seeing the merchant will not 
          receive a less quantity, neither will he deal at all, unless the 
          tobacco lyes convenient to his Receiver ; and by this means 
          the poor planter is often obliged to take goods that are of little 
          or no use to him, and at what price his neighbouring storekeeper 
          pleases to impose, because he cannot otherwise have what he 
          really hath occasion for ; This has indeed proved a discourage- 
          ment to many industrious people, and must in time obliged them 
          to leave off planting, and apply their labour to better purpose. 
          But by this act the greatest encouragement is given to the 
          common people to make tobacco that could be then thought 
          of : for after their tobacco hath passed an inspection, they may 
          take as many notes for it as they please ; i.e., notes for fiftys 
          or hundred pounds, dividing their tobacco into what parcels 
          they think proper ; these notes, the same as money, will be 
          accepted as payment at any store or shop, and as it is much 
          easier for a planter to carry home his goods, than to remove 
          his tobacco to the conveniency of the merchant, he will not 
          henceforward be confined to one particular merchant, but will 
          be at liberty to deal where he can meet with the best goods and 
          the best purchase. These advantages being what the common 
          planters see their account in, they are, and will be, more 
          particularly fond of the method proposed for payment in these 
          transfer notes, and will thereby be incited to apply themselves 
          to this manufacture with greater attention than they have 
          hitherto done, under the disadvantage of being stinted in their 
          plants, a low price and an useless return. As to lessening the 
          consumption by advancing the price, I can see no ground to 
          apprehend such a consequence : for since the rich and even 
          people of middling fortunes will ever be fonder of smoking good 
          than bad tobacco, be the price what it will ; so custom having 
          made smoaking as necessary as food to the labourer and 
          mechanick, it will not be an half-penny, or penny pr. pound 
          that will lessen the consumption of what they find necessary 
          to the gratification of their desires : but 'tis rather to be expected 
          that a more agreable tobacco will draw them into a greater 
          inclination to use a much larger quantity : Besides, that which 
          is sold at a very low price in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>,
          to the poor people, is not tobacco, but the stalks flatted and cut up by the tobacconists. 
          A commodity which ought not to be vended, the prohibiting 
          whereof must be submitted to the wisdom of the British 
          Parliament, (ii) This is answered by the fact that the poor 
          planters make the best tobacco etc. Believes there was the same 
          quantity of tobacco consumed in England when it was sold at 
          10d. pr. lb., as now, when it is sunk to 8d. or 7d. If there is no 
          tobacco so bad as to deserve to be burned as unmerchantable, 
          the King's revenue must be increased proportionately etc. 
          Further discussion of fraudulent running of tobacco etc. Con- 
          tinues : I must now beg your Lordships to consider some of the 
          consequences which must unavoidably follow the disallowance 
          of this act. (i) As the Tobacco trade is sunk to that degree that 
          abundance of the planters are no longer able to live by it, and 
          are in some hopes of relief from the regulations now proposed, 
          if that fails, they must of necessity leave off planting or starve 
          for want of cloathing and tools to work with, (ii) The last 
          session there was a considerable party in the House that opposed 
          this act, also strongly insisted on reducing the quantity of 
          tobacco to be planted to no more than 3000 plants for each 
          tithable, which in the most favourable year would hardly 
          amount to 20,000 hhds. But as I assured them I could pass 
          no such act, I had the good fortune, I must still cal it so, to 
          prevail with them to try this experiment, in which everybody 
          here sees how much the interest of the revenue has been con- 
          sidered, and if we are so unhappy to be disapointed in this, I 
          know no other expedient, consistent with H.M. interest, to 
          keep up the spirits of the people from sinking into despair of 
          ever being able to retrieve the miserable circumstances into 
          which the continued bad price of their tobacco for several years 
          past hath plunged them. And it is to be feared that many 
          poor familys will desert the country and retire to the new 
          settlements that are making in <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName>  
          to get out of the reach of their creditors. And what effect this must have on H.M. 
          revenue as well as the British trade, I humbly submit to your 
          Lordships. I cannot but express my concern, with an aching 
          heart my Lords, that any private representation of the state 
          of <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">this Colony</placeName>, or the interest of the people, 
          with regard to H.M. advantage, should have more weight with the 
          Commissioners of the Customs, than the united and deliberate sentiments 
          of the whole Legislature : and for my own part, tho' I had some 
          share in carrying this act in the Assembly, yet, I shal be  
          contented to own myself in the wrong, if any just arguments can 
          be brought against it, but hitherto I have heard of none. Some 
          are prejudiced against it from private interest others fancie 
          they know more of the trade than they really do, etc., and a 
          few, who being used to a beaten path of business, are unwilling 
          to go out of their way, tho' they are led in to a better and an 
          amended road. Before I conclude your Lordships will suffer 
          me to do justice to myself. Under the late repealed law of a 
          stint (of 6000 plants per tithable etc.), the country in a favourable 
          year made 40,000 hhds. of good and bad tobacco which was 
          constantly sent to <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>. All rents, and publick dues, 
          as the Parish, the Country, and the Country levies, which the 
          planters are to discharge by an equal tax pr. tithable, were paid, 
          it will be believed, not with their best tobacco ; insomuch, to 
          instance in one article only, the King's quit-rents, tobacco, 
          with the inconveniency the buyers were under in collecting 
          such tobacco, was generally sold from 3s. to 5s. pr. cwt. at the 
          same time that the current price all over the country was 10s. 
          and 12s. at least. Under this new law, which leaves every 
          planter at liberty to make as much tobacco as he can, it is taken 
          for granted, that the Colony in a seasonable year will make 
          about 60,000 hhds., and 'tis imagined, if the Inspectors do their 
          duty, that one fifth part or more will be destroyed as trash. 
          By which method the 45,000, or it may be 48,000 hhds. passed 
          will be all very good and fit for any market, and out of this the 
          quit-rents and all other dues will be paid, and the publick 
          tobacco will then sell for as much money in the country or 
          elsewhere, as any other. 'Tis also proposed, that by the 
          goodness of the tobacco we shal encourage an increase of the 
          consumption : and this act, my Lords, as far as we are able to 
          guard against frauds, secures the duty of all that is consumed 
          in G. Britain to the King etc. Maintains that the advantages 
          of the Customs and the interest of the people are so linkt 
          together by this apt disposition, that 'tis impossible for man 
          to devise a better. The delay caused will prevent the first year 
          being a proper trial, but if any defects are revealed, future 
          Assemblies will remedy them etc. Signed, William Gooch.

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. By all 
          opportunities I have done myself the honour of transmitting 
          to your Grace the account of my proceedings etc. Continues : 
          Since my last I have conven'd a new Assembly, which has been 
          sitting near three weeks. Encloses Journal. They have still 
          under their consideration the matter of the Govr.'s support 
          and what they will finally do in it, I am not able to say. But 
          according to the best judgment I can make, I don't expect they 
          will do anything that will come nearer to the King's Instruction, 
          than what was done by the last Assembly. As I have not been 
          wanting to do everything in my power for the King's honour 
          and service, so I am still determin'd to pursue my duty to the 
          King in all the ways I possibly can etc. The Agrent will wait 
          on your Grace with the copy of the process of the Jourts against 
          the rioters mentioned 14th Jan. etc. Continues : I don't 
          suppose Collo. Dunbar's pride and malice would stick at any- 
          thing (whether true or false) he thought would hurt me, so I 
          hope your Grace will prevent any orders to me for the future 
          from anything Collo. Dunbar may write till I am serv'd with a 
          copy to make answer etc. Repeats request for leave to sign Act

        <p>Mr. Fane to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Reply to Feb. 19. I have reconsidered the acts of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> 
          referred to, and am humbly of opinion that H.M. cannot by any 
          instruction to his Governor vary or alter an Act of Assembly 
          ratified by the Crown, nor can H.M. in my humble apprehension 
          by virtue of an Instruction which the act of 1715 is observed 
          prevent his Governor granting or dissolving injunctions in causes 
          depending in Antigua whilst he is resident in any other island 
          of <placeName ref="#leeward" role="indirect">his Government</placeName>. Because as I am informed this practice 
          prevailed long before the act of 1715 took place : and I take 
          it that what was the usage in this particular before the act of 
          1715 is now by that act become a law of the island. It being 
          enacted by that law that all injunctions, subpoenas and other 
          process shall be granted signed and sealed by the Governour 
          as hath been usuall and no otherwise, and I know no method of 
          altering it, but by a subsequent law, and I begg leave to observe 
          to your Lordships that all regulations and amendments of the

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Duke of 
          Newcastle. Reply to 27th Feb. Continue : We do not find 
          anything in the papers your Grace has sent us, that shoud 
          incline us to alter our sentiments upon this subject, for not- 
          withstanding Mr. Belcher does in his letter deny that he ever 
          had any intention to march with an armed force in order to 
          demolish the fort at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName>, and carry away the people 
          prisoners from thence, yet he does not deny that he ever told 
          Colo. Dunbar, that some Members of ye Assembly had such an 
          intention, and he does likewise acknowledge that ye Sherrif 
          of <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">York County</placeName> did march thither with his posse about that 
          time, tho' upon a different occasion, which might very justly 
          give Collo. Dunbar reason to be alarm'd, and he certainly would 
          have been wanting in his duty to ye King, if in that situation, 
          he had not apply'd to H.M. for an order to prevent hostilities 
          till such time at least as H.M. title to that tract of land should 
          be determined. It is not to be doubted but that Colo. Dunbar's 
          Office as Surveyor of the Woods, as well as his Instructions for 
          settling ye lands betwen <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="boundary">Kennebeck</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#rv_stcroix" role="boundary">Croix</placeName> must have 
          rais'd him many enemies in <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">ye Massachusets Bay</placeName>, where it is 
          but too evident that every man who does his duty to the Crown, 
          makes himself liable to ye ill will of ye people ; and therefore 
          stands in need of all the support the Government can give him 
          from hence, for which reason it was, that we first beg'd your 
          Grace's favour on his behalf, and for ye same reason we now 
          take ye liberty to repeat that request, as apprehending that ye 
          employment of Lt. Gov. of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, may give him 
          a little more credit and authority, than he is at present possessed

          Col. Hayes to [? the Duke of Newcastle]. Yesterday 
          I lost my Major etc. Requests that his eldest Captain, Capt. 
          Hely may be appointed to succeed him etc. I suppose you 
          have heard of the defeat of the negros with an utter destruction 
          of all their habitations by a party of the country people who 
          attack'd them for an hour and a half without ever seeing one 
          of them, att length enter'd the town and after plundering itt, 
          laid itt in ashes, but took no one prisoner, this victory was 
          obtain'd with the loss only of two men. I believe we may now 
          naturaly conclude the war is over in this country. To-morrow 
          the companies of the two Regmts. march to the several quarters 
          alotted in the country, which I hear a miserable account of. 
          I have reason to beleive in some of them their will be wanting 
          both provisions and lodgings etc. The men now begin to be 
          verey sickly and die verey fast. By the inclos'd list of the 
          quarters etc., you'l find I have two companys quartered together, 
          ownly, in one place, the rest are scater'd all over <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">the island</placeName>, 
          some of them 200 miles asunder. When the Regiment is 
          dispersed, I am certain I can be of no further use here etc. His 
          health being very bad, asks for leave to return etc. Signed,

          Mr. Carkesse to Mr. Popple. Explains how the 
          Commissioners' report was framed without hearing Mr. Leheup. 
          They reply to his memorial (22nd Feb.). (i) As to the dirt, 
          rubbish which it is alledged the planters often mix with their 
          tobacco which tend to depreciate its esteem in foreign parts, 
          the officers in this port have met with no such instance, and if 
          the planters should do so, it would be no prejudice to the revenue 
          or any advantage to the importer, for it is liable to the same 
          duty as good tobacco, (ii) As to the great discoverys of frauds 
          that have been lately made here, for which great number of 
          officers have been dismist and others transported, the Commrs. 
          have good reason to believe that the prosecutions carried on have 
          put a stop to those frauds, but if not they do not apprehend 
          that a law passed in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName>, which can be of no force here, 
          can be any ways serviceable in preventing them, (iii) As to 
          ordinary or mean tobacco, the Commrs. are still of opinion 
          if by virtue of this law the importation thereof shoud be lessened 
          it will be prejudiciall to the revenue, it paying the same duty 
          as the best, tho' the revenue is not increased by what is shipt 
          off, yet the trade is thereby increased with the Northern countrys 
          they taking off great quantitys of this sort of tobacco, (iv) As 
          to the 1/2d. per lb. which the Crown pays for all bad tobacco burnt 
          here which charge Mr. Leheup says will by this act be saved, he 
          is misinformed, for the 1/2d. by law is not to be paid for such 
          tobacco as was damaged or unmerchantable in Virginia before 
          it was ship'd here, but only for such tobacco as happens to 
          receive damage by stress of weather or accident at sea etc., 
          which damage on ship board the Commrs. apprehend will 
          be increased by the Inspector's breaking the tobacco after it is 
          first packed before the shipping it being impossible to pack it 
          up again so close as it was at first, (v) As to the Navall Officer 
          sending over the exact quantitys of tobacco each ship takes on 
          board, there being no penaltys laid by this law as was observed 
          in my former letter, the Commrs. do not see any service 
          that can be to prevent the running of tobacco in <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>. 
          The other parts of Mr. Leheup's memorial relating to trade in 
          general, and not to this revenue, the Commrs. do not 
          think proper to make any observations thereon, but have 
          directed Mr. Fitzwilliams, Surveyor General for the Customs of 
          Virginia and other parts of the Southern Continent in America, 
          who has resided long in that country, and is an officer of whom 
          they have a very good opinion to wait on their Lordships to 
          answer such questions as they shall please to ask him relating 
          to this law etc. Signed, Cha. Carkesse. Endorsed, Recd. 12th

        <p>Mr. Fitzwilliam to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          In obedience to their commands has considered the Act of 
          <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> for amending the staple of tobacco, and con- 
          ceives it "to be highly prejudicial to the British merchants 
          trading to that country ; that it lays the poorer sort of planters 
          under such difficulties as in a short time must oblige them to 
          leave off planting, and betake themselves to some manufacture ; 
          that it vests such a power in Inspectors as no sett of men ought 
          to be entrusted with " etc. Explains at length. Mr. Leheup is 
          wrong in saying that the 3s. for stamps and nailing etc. will be but 
          a small expense to planters, for by the present custom of buying 
          nearly 4 lbs. of the tobacco pays nothing in the country for 
          weighing and nailing. Continues : As to what is alledged of 
          the planters being the best judges of what benefit will accrue 
          to their own trade, if that be admitted, yet I presume they are 
          not to be allowed proper judges of the Trade and Navigation of 
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> etc. If we look back but a very few years, we 
          may observe very extraordinary steps taken in the Governmt. 
          of Virginia to lessen, as much as in them lyes, both the revenue, 
          and the trade, by discouraging everybody from making tobacco, 
          in order to gain a monopoly etc. In 1726 there was a law passed 
          in Virginia for the more effectual preventing the bringing of tobacco 
          from N. Carolina etc., which is an effectual prohibition on 
          the people of <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="indirect">North Carolina</placeName> to plant tobacco. For that 
          province has no ports capable of admitting ships of burthen, 
          etc., and as Virginia has hitherto been the port from whence the 
          tobacco of that province has been conveyed to Great Britain, 
          the lessening of H.M. revenue must be the consequence of this 
          prohibition. But what makes the act still more extraordinary 
          is, that it is repugnant to an act of Parliament, notwithstanding 
          which, penalties have been recovered contrary to this act of 
          Parliament in the Courts of Common Law of Virginia, which 
          has lessened the importation of tobacco betwen 2 and 3000 
          hhds. yearly etc. Refers to his letter of Dec. 1727. Continues : 
          Upon an application made to the Parliamt. last sessions, the 
          law for preventing the importation of stemm'd tobacco, or 
          tobacco stripped from the stalk, was repealed, whereby the 
          quantity of tobacco usually stripped from Virginia was lessen'd 
          at least 6000 hhds. more, as may appear from the Customhouse 
          books, yet this indulgence, wch. consequently lessens the trade 
          of Great Britain to that country at least 20 sail of ships yearly, 
          had not satisfied them, but now in 1730 they pass this act of 
          their own, in order further to lessen the quantity of this com- 
          modity, whereby they propose to raise the price by preventing 
          the poorer sort of people from planting which must materially 
          give them a turn to manufacturing etc. As to the Lt. Governor's 
          interest in the act, besides his influence in settling the rent of 
          the warehouses, which is near equal to giving an employmt., 
          he will have the disposal of the new offices created by this act 
          to the value of near 6000£. pr. annum etc. Concludes : It is 
          generally computed that the execution of this act will cost the 
          country between 10 and 12,000£. a year etc. The inhabitants 
          have not yet been at any expense in building warehouses etc. 
          for executing it. There was a law of this nature in Virginia 
          called the Agents law, abot. 13 or 14 years agoe, which tho' 
          not near so bad in its consequences, was repealed as being 
          prejudicial to the trade of Great Britain. Signed, Rd.

          Capt. Coram to Mr. Popple. I have understood there 
          hath been some late enquirery about iron being made out of the 
          oar in <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName>, and wrought there into the necessary tools 
          and utensils of husbandry etc. of that country which I well 
          know to be truth. Moreover in the year 1697, the convenian[c]y 
          of the vast great planks of oak and fir timber, and iron oar 
          which I found abounding at a place call'd <placeName ref="#us_ma_taunton" role="direct">Taunton</placeName>, on a 
          navigable river about 50 miles south of <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="indirect">Boston</placeName> by land, but 
          much more by water, in some like manner as Winchester is 
          from London ; encouraged me to take some of my English 
          shipwrights from Boston whome I had carryd. from <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">hence</placeName>
          thither thre years before for establishing shipbuilding in New 
          England, and removed them to Taunton to build a ship of 140 
          tonns (the first ship or vessel that ever had been built on that 
          river) and had all the ironwork or much the greater part thereof 
          used in building her made out of the iron oar of that place and 
          wrought into bolts and spikes and nailes etc., by an engenious 
          fellow named Robert Grossman born at that place, and was 
          since the Representative for the same many years in the General 
          Assembly of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts</placeName>. I built several more and larger 
          ships there soon after, and there has been built since above 500 
          ships on the same river, and I doubt not but with the ironworke 
          for them, the natural produce of the same place wch. also 
          produced good hemp and flax to those few who were industrious 
          to take any care or pains to raise it etc. Signed, Thomas Coram.

          Encloses following. Was disappointed of an earlier conveyance etc.
          Signed, P. Gordon. Endorsed, Recd. 28th Sept., 1731, Read 4th Oct., 1732. 1 p. Enclosed, 
          89. i. Answers of the Lt. Governor of Pensylvania to the 
          Board's Queries. (i) Describes situation and 
          boundaries of grant etc. of <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="direct">Pennsylvania</placeName>
          and the <placeName ref="#us_de" role="direct">Three Lower Counties</placeName>, 
          (ii) The boundaries are nowhere fixed but on the East by the 
          <placeName ref="#rv_delaware" role="boundary">River Delaware</placeName>. On 
          the North there has never yet been any occasion to 
          fix the 43rd degree, which 'tis conceived extends to the 
          <placeName ref="#us_ny_iroquoia" role="indirect">settlements of the Five Nations</placeName> now supposed by the 
          Government of <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="indirect">New York</placeName> to belong to that Province. 
          Nor have any attempts been made to measure off the 
          five degrees of longitude (which is the breadth of the 
          Province by the King's patent, and would make about 
          265 miles) to the westward, but by the exactest French 
          maps yet given us, particularly De L'Isle's, the North- 
          west corner by these degrees of longitude and latitude 
          will fall on <placeName ref="#lk_great" role="boundary">their Lakes</placeName> etc. The French in their said 
          maps extend their <placeName ref="#us_la" role="indirect">Louisiana</placeName> as far East as the
          <placeName ref="#rv_susquehanna" role="boundary">River Susquehannah</placeName> which runs into the head of
          <placeName ref="#by_chesapeake" role="boundary">Chesapeak</placeName>, by which the Eastern and Western shores 
          (as they are commonly called) both of <placeName ref="#us_md" role="indirect">Maryland</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#us_va" role="indirect">Virginia</placeName> are 
          divided, and therefore they leave to Pensylvania a 
          breadth only of about 60 Eng. miles. It is also 
          remarkable that the Editors of a volume of Geography 
          published in a very large folio anno 1721 by subscrip- 
          tion from many of the Nobility and great Officers of 
          Britain as well as others called A New General Atlas, 
          the maps in which are engraved or revised by Senex, 
          have, to the scandal of the Nation, unadvisedly inserted 
          into it that Map of Louisiana as a proper description 
          of that country, without any alteration or restriction, 
          by which, as far as the authority of that book can 
          contribute, they give up to the French all their 
          exorbitant claims to the greater part of these British 
          Dominions, which whether it may deserve the notice 
          of your Honourable Board is humbly submitted, but 
          it cannot but give those who have considered the 
          mistake and have any concern for the honour and 
          interest of the Crown of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>
          a very just resentment. The boundary of Pensylvania to the 
          Southward is a circle about Newcastle at 12 miles 
          distance so farr as that reaches, and from thence a 
          line running directly west is to divide it from Maryland. 
          This line in the Royal grants for both Provinces is 
          called the fortieth degree of Northern Latitude, which 
          occasions a very high dispute, for it is most evident 
          by both patents, that at the respective times of the 
          grants, it was not conceived, that what is commonly 
          understood by the 40th degree of latitude would 
          extend near so far northward on the land, as it is now 
          found from later observations by more exact land 
          instruments. Maryland in the patent to Lord 
          Baltemore seems positively limited to <placeName ref="#rv_delaware" role="boundary">Delaware Bay</placeName>
          which ends somewhat to the southward of Newcastle 
          etc. The whole tenour of that grant appears to bound 
          it by the heads of the Bay of Delaware and Chesapeak. 
          It can also be clearly proved, that the first grantee of 
          Maryland understood his province to be bounded by 
          the head of Chesapeak Bay, and about 1683 not much 
          above one year after Mr. Penn first arrived here with 
          his people to settle his Colony, the then Lord Baltemore 
          being himself in these parts thought fitt to run a line 
          a few miles above the head of the said Bay, to which 
          line he formally made his claim, and to that boundary 
          as allow'd on the part of Maryland this Province has 
          ever since extended its settlements, and great numbers 
          of families near 50 years since sate down and laid out 
          their substance in improving the said lands, and raising 
          estates, which have descended to their children etc. 
          Yet now from the later discoveries that have been 
          made of the latitude, Maryland would extend their 
          countrey much higher and take to themselves a con- 
          siderable part of those estates : But our inhabitants 
          have hitherto held their possessions. The claim 
          nevertheless on the part of Maryland still subsisting 
          occasions great uneasiness amongst the people. And 
          tho' the respective Governors, who live in a good 
          understanding with each other, have hitherto shewn, 
          and still continue to use, such moderation and caution 
          on both sides, as that no violences, by the countenance 
          of either Government, have been committed, yet it is 
          of vast importance to the publick peace and security 
          of H.M. good subjects, as well as for the interest of the 
          Proprietors, that this dispute should with as little 
          delay as possible be effectually ended, (iii) Describes 
          Constitution and Courts, (iv) The shipping annually 
          cleared from <placeName ref="#us_pa_philadelphia" role="direct">Philadelphia</placeName>, 
          <placeName ref="#us_de_newcastle" role="direct">Newcastle</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#us_de_lewes" role="direct">Lewes</placeName>, the 
          three ports of trade within this Government, are 
          computed to be about 170, and as they consist chiefly 
          of sloops and small briganteens they cannot be reckoned 
          one with another to exceed 60 tons with a complement 
          of 7 men to each vessel etc. For these last ten years 
          the shipping are encreased one full third, (v) As this 
          with all other of the American Provinces are limited 
          to trade only with Britain, and H.M. Colonies, and no 
          goods from Britain pay any duties, there is therefore 
          no occasion to have any such entries made as can 
          enable us to render an exact account of the quantities, 
          but the sorts are generally such dry goods as are con- 
          sumed in Great Britain vizt. woollens, linens, silks, 
          habedashry etc. necessary for apparell, ironware 
          and other necessaries for husbandry building and 
          furniture of houses, (vi) There is no considerable 
          trade between this Government and any foreign 
          Plantations ; what there is, is chiefly with the Dutch 
          vizt. three or four small vessells in a year to <placeName ref="#gr" role="indirect">Surinam</placeName>, 
          perhaps one to <placeName ref="#curacao" role="indirect">Curaçoa</placeName>, and sometimes one to
          <placeName ref="#steustatius" role="indirect">St. Eustacia</placeName>, but none to any French or Spanish
          Plantations. Our exports thither are bread, flour, staves, 
          butter and some horses, and our returns are chiefly 
          melasses, some little rum and sugar. Our trade to 
          <placeName ref="#europe" role="indirect">Europe</placeName> is but casual, and according as there is demand 
          for grain, in which case, as in the late scarcity of wheat 
          in Europe about 40,000 bushels were shipt from hence to
          <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName>, <placeName ref="#pt_lisbon" role="indirect">Lisbon</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">the Streights</placeName>, but when there 
          are plentifull crops we ship little or none. To <placeName ref="#madeira" role="indirect">Madeira</placeName>
          there is shipt annually between 15 and 20,000 bushels 
          of wheat, some Indian corn and bread, in return for 
          which we have their wines. We now also sometimes 
          import salt from <placeName ref="#pt" role="indirect">Portugal</placeName>
          or <placeName ref="#es" role="indirect">Spain</placeName>, tho' rarely, most 
          of it being brought from the <placeName ref="#indies" role="indirect">West Indies</placeName>,
          (vii) At Philadelphia there are a Naval Officer, a Collector and 
          Comptroller, at Newcastle and Lewes a Naval Officer 
          and Collector each, who guard the trade, and all proper 
          care is taken to prevent any illegal practices therein, 
          so that notwithstanding the vigilancy of the Officers, 
          there are but very few forfeitures on that score, (viii) 
          The produce of this country and stapl: commodities 
          are wheat and Indian corn for exportation, rye, barley, 
          oats and buckwheat enough for home consumption, 
          but very little exported. Wheat manufactured into 
          flour and bread, barrell'd beef and pork in a reasonable 
          proportion to suit the cargoes of bread and flour for 
          the West Indies, hogshead and barrell staves in great 
          quantities are shipt off annually to the West Indies, 
          Madeira, Lisbon etc. ; skins and furrs (which are pur- 
          chased of the Indians in exchange of woollens, linens, 
          shott cutlery etc. all from Britain) with some pigg 
          iron annually are shipt off for Great Britain, also ships 
          built here make a considerable return, and our exports 
          in the whole may be computed at about 70,000£., or 
          80,000£. sterl., but make less or more according to the 
          markets they meet with. In return to our exports to 
          the W. Indies we have litle else than rum in but too 
          large quantities, with melasses and sugar which are 
          consumed in the country. Divers undertakers here, in 
          hopes of making large returns by iron, have to theire 
          very great cost erected furnaces, but the low price of 
          pigg iron in Britain for these two years past has proved 
          a very great discouragement and disappointment, so 
          that some of these furnaces are like to fall. Great 
          endeavours have also been used, with a bounty from 
          the Government, to promote the raising of hemp, in 
          expectation of making a return by it to Britain, but 
          very litle as yet has been exported. We have also 
          hopes that the raising of silk, which has been tried 
          with some success, may in time be pursued by the 
          inhabitants, our climate and soil very well agreeing 
          with the silkworm, and mulberry tree, (ix) We know 
          of no mines as yet but iron, and some litle copper, of 
          which last in this Province no discoveries have as yet 
          been made that countervail the trouble and charge. 
          (x) This Government has not hitherto had occasion to 
          use any method that can furnish us with an exact 
          estimate, but as near as can at present be guessed there 
          may be about 45,000 souls of whites and 4000 blacks, 
          (xi) The inhabitants have been exceedingly encreased 
          within these last ten years by means of their continued 
          resort hither from Great Britain, Ireland, <placeName ref="#de" role="indirect">Germany</placeName>
          etc. from which two last we have of late had great 
          numbers, and 'tis beleived within these ten years the 
          inhabitants have encreased above one half of what 
          they were before (xii, xiii). This being an inland 
          Province no forts have been built, nor is there any 
          formed Militia in it. (xiv) The number of Indians 
          inhabiting this Province is very much decreased, and 
          those which remain scarce exceed 600 men, excluding 
          the five Nations etc., and at the first settlement of this 
          Colony such measures were taken with them by Mr. 
          Penn, which are still carefully continued, that they 
          have lived in perfect peace with the inhabitants, and 
          they are very well affected to the British interest, 
          (xv) As to the strength of the neighbouring Indians, 
          encloses a paper drawn up in 1718 by Mr. Logan, a 
          gentleman of good literature and large experience, 
          who having been himself engaged in the Indian trade, 
          from the informations he collected from some who 
          had long and often travelled through <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName>, and the 
          country about <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="indirect">Missassippi</placeName>, drew up at the request of 
          Sir Wm. Keith then Governor of this Province an 
          account of the French trade, their routes and their 
          Indians, etc., to be transmitted to your Board in answer 
          to some queries then sent him. How Sir William 
          might transmitt it I know not, but as it appears to me 
          curious and valueable, with that gentleman's leave, 
          who has lent me his original draught, I here give you 
          an exact copy etc. (xvi, xvii). All claims of the 
          Spaniards lye so remote, that no occasion has been 
          given us to have any knowledge of, or concern about, 
          them. The French of Canada are much nearer neigh- 
          bours, but fall principally under the notice of H.M. 
          Government of New York, from whence undoubtedly 
          the best informations may be had : yet Mr. Logan's 
          paper may give your Lops, considerable information, 
          (xviii) Revenue : By the emission of a paper currency, 
          an annual interest arises thereon amounting to near 
          3000£. this currency, which with a small excise on 
          spirits not amounting to 1000£. yearly raise together 
          a sufficiency to answer all the present exigencies of 
          this Government, (xix) By order of the Assemblies 
          annually there is generally paid to the Governor about 
          1200£. pr. annum besides perquisites ; some further 
          allowances are likewise made to the Provincial Judges, 
          Treasurer, Attorney General and Trustees of the Loan 
          Office, the bounties also and charge of Indian Treaties 
          take a part but generally at the end of the year the 
          accounts are near a balance, (xx) There are no 
          establishments here, for there being no Militia, there 
          is consequently no military one, and the Officers of the 
          Government have either such annual allowances made 
          to them as the Assemblies think proper, or the fees of 
          their offices as established by our laws, and generally 
          they hold their places by commission from the 
          Proprietor or his Lieutenant during pleasure. Signed,

        <p>Paper drawn up by Mr. Logan in 1718, referred to 
          in preceding. The memorial of which the Lords 
          Commissioners have transmitted a copy etc. appears 
          well-grounded. 'Tis well known that ever since the 
          expedition of the Sieur La Salle, the French have 
          claimed all the lands to the northward and westward 
          of the British Colonies, from <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName> along the Lakes 
          and <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="indirect">Messassippi River</placeName>, in which they further strengthen 
          themselves, by alledging, that the Article in the Treaty 
          of Reswick, by which all lands or rivers in America 
          of the mouth of which either nation were then possessed 
          are conceded to that nation as high as the first sources 
          of those rivers, is a full cession of all that tract of land 
          to the French : tho' it cannot be probable that it was 
          ever so intended, because 'tis not only inconsistent 
          with the ancienter grant from the Crown to the Proprietors
          of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName>, but with the security of all the 
          British Colonies on this <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">Continent of America</placeName>. From 
          the time of their first discoveries of Missassippi they 
          have with great care settled a communication between 
          Canada and the <placeName ref="#us_la" role="indirect">Southern countries</placeName> on that river, for 
          which they have three different routes all of which are 
          the same as far as <placeName ref="#lk_erie" role="indirect">Lake Erie</placeName>.
          They sail in canoes from <placeName ref="#ca_qc_montreal" role="indirect">Montreal</placeName>
          abt. 3 leagues to the <placeName ref="#lachine" role="indirect">fall of St. Louis</placeName>, where 
          they have a portage or carrying place by land of about 
          half a league, then they reimbarque row up the stream 
          about 60 leagues to <placeName ref="#ca_on_frontenac" role="indirect">fort Frontenac</placeName> on the north side, 
          and at the beginning of <placeName ref="#lk_ontario" role="indirect">Lake Ontario</placeName>; In this fort is 
          a small garrison consisting of one or two companies in 
          the King's pay, from thence they proceed on the Lake 
          Ontario generally reputed to be 80 leagues in length 
          to those dreadfull <placeName ref="#niagarafalls" role="indirect">Falls of Niagara</placeName>, which oblige them 
          to land, the portage is about three leagues, after 
          reimbarquing, they goe up the <placeName ref="#rv_niagara" role="indirect">Strait</placeName> about 6 leagues, 
          after which they enter Lake Erie which they call 130 
          leagues in length. The shortest passage from hence 
          to Missassippi by water is to goe up
          <placeName ref="#rv_maumee" role="indirect">the river of the Miamies or Oumamies</placeName>
          that enters Lake Erie on the 
          Southwest about 150 leagues, they then come to 
          another carrying place of about 3 leagues, where the 
          highest land is, and from hence the waters divide their 
          descent between Missassippi and that lake, there they 
          imbarque on a small shallow river called La Riviere 
          de Portage, down which they row 40 leagues, to the 
          <placeName ref="#rv_wabash" role="indirect">River Wabash or Ouabache</placeName>, and on that river 
          according to the traders reckoning 120 leagues to the
          <placeName ref="#rv_ohio" role="indirect">river Ohio</placeName>, into which the other falls, then 80 leagues down 
          Ohio to Missassippi and thence 350 leagues to the
          <placeName ref="#gf_mexico" role="indirect">Bay of Mexico</placeName>. Some call both these rivers by the same 
          name, and generally Wabache, but they ought to be 
          distinguished, because the head of Ohio comes much 
          more easterly, extending even to the Government of <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="indirect">New York</placeName>
          towards <placeName ref="#us_va" role="indirect">Virginia</placeName> or Carolina, and among 
          divers other large streams it receives the <placeName ref="#rv_tennessee" role="indirect">River Peresippi</placeName>
          on the south side, not far from the mouth 
          of Wabache, which river of Perisippi is said to rise in 
          the mountains of Virginia and Carolina. The other 
          two passages are both prick'd down in Hennepin's 
          map, according to the accounts given are thus. From 
          the North-west of Lake Erie they sail 8 leagues to a 
          fort on <placeName ref="#lk_stclair" role="indirect">Lake St. Claire</placeName> called Erie
          <placeName ref="#us_mi_fortdetroit" role="indirect">Pont Chartrain</placeName>
          where there is a settlement of the French, and often 
          400 traders meet here, then along the Lake 7 leagues, 
          thence to the great <placeName ref="#lk_huron" role="indirect">Lake Huron</placeName> about 10 leagues, 
          on this lake they proceed to the <placeName ref="#mackinac">Straits of Missilimakina</placeName> 
          120 leagues, here is a Garrison of about 30 French, 
          and a vast concourse of traders, sometimes not less 
          than a thousand besides Indians, being a common 
          place of rendezvous. At or near this place are the 
          Outawas settled. From Lake Huron they pass by 
          the strait Misilimakina 4 leagues being 2 in breadth, 
          and of a great depth to the <placeName ref="#lk_michigan" role="indirect">Lake Illinois</placeName>, thence 150 
          leagues on the Lake to Fort Miami situate on the 
          mouth of the <placeName ref="#rv_chicago" role="indirect">River Chigagow</placeName>. This fort is not 
          regularly garrison'd, from hence came those Indians 
          of the same name vizt. Miamies, who are settled on 
          the aforementioned river that runs into Erie. Up 
          the River Chigagow they sail but 3 leagues to a portage 
          of a quarter of a league, then they enter a small Lake 
          of about a mile, and have another very small portage, 
          and again another of 2 miles to the <placeName ref="#rv_illinois" role="indirect">River Illinois</placeName>, 
          thence down the same 130 leagues to Missasippi. The third is from 
          Misilimakina on Lake Illinois to the <placeName ref="#by_green" role="indirect">Lake des Puans</placeName>
          90 leagues, thence to the <placeName ref="#rv_fox" role="indirect">River Puans</placeName> 80 
          leagues, thence up the same to a portage of about 4 
          miles over to the <placeName ref="#rv_wisconsin" role="indirect">River Ouisconsing</placeName>, thence 40 leagues 
          to Missassippi. From the mouth of Ouisconsing to 
          the mouth of the River Illinois is reputed about 150 
          leagues on Missasippi, and from thence to the mouth 
          of Ohio 70 leagues etc. These distances are as the 
          traders reckon them, but they appear to be generally 
          overdone, which may be owing to those people's 
          coasting along the shores of the Lakes, and taking in 
          all the windings of the rivers. The French use their 
          utmost endeavours to bring over all the Indians into 
          their interest, the Iroquese or five Nations have stood 
          chiefly in their way, but by their Jesuites and other 
          means they daily debauch them from the English. 
          The number of the whole is not now above 2000 fighting 
          men, of which the French have drawn over 700 to 
          inhabit amongst themselves, vizt. 400 seated at the 
          Fall of St. Louis on the south side of <placeName ref="#rv_stlawrence" role="indirect">St. Laurence</placeName> and 
          300 on the north side, the rest of them are planted 
          chiefly along the Lake Ontario at some distance from 
          it. There are no Indians in the French interest on 
          this side of St. Laurence nearer than the Miamies or 
          Twechtwese as the Iroquese call them who are about 
          2000 seated chiefly on the aforementioned river 
          Miamis flowing into Lake Erie and on or near the 
          branches of Oubache. The Illinois are about 3,000 men 
          on and near the river of that name. The Misilimakinaes 
          or Outtawas were formerly 3000 but now are scarce 500. 
          The Nokes 100, the Fellesavoins 200, the Sakes 200, the 
          Puans 600. All these joyned with the French against 
          the Iroquese, and all of them except the Mimaies are
          seated about or near to the Lake Illinois, which is now 
          commonly call'd by them Mechegan, and on the rivers 
          that run into it, and on Lake Puans and the River 
          Illinois. There are also divers other nations between 
          Mechegan and Missasippi, as the Renards or Foxes, 
          Massekobins, Kikapous, but these being further off, 
          did not joyn the French against the Iroquese. On 
          Missasippi and the branches of it there are many great 
          Nations, especially to the West as the Missouris, 
          Ozages, Acansias, who are different from those of 
          Acansa on the East, with many more, not less as is 
          affirmed, than 60,000 men, with all of whom the French 
          have peace and some alliance. On the other hand all 
          the English to the northward of Carolina have not 
          1500 men in their interest excepting the Iroquese. In 
          <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="secondary">New England</placeName> and
          <placeName ref="#us_ct" role="secondary">Connecticut</placeName> they have very few. In
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="secondary">New York</placeName> they have only the River Indians besides 
          the Iroquese. In <placeName ref="#us_nj" role="secondary">Jersey</placeName> and
          <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="secondary">Pensylvania</placeName> their own 
          or home Indians called Delawares are exceedingly 
          decreased, and being in subjection to the Iroquese 
          take their rules from them. In <placeName ref="#us_md" role="secondary">Maryland</placeName> and Virginia 
          there are very few, excepting those whom Colonel 
          Spottswood with great industry has lately established 
          there. Those of Carolina and the nations lately in 
          friendship have been very numerous. But the 
          Iroquese, whether prompted by the French, or 
          from what other cause is not yet known, have of 
          late years made great inroads upon them, and cannot 
          as yet by any endeavours of the English be diverted 
          from it. But of all these people the best accounts will 
          naturally come from Carolina.           
          The methods that may be proposed to prevent the 
          designs of the French seem to be these, (i) To use all 
          reasonable endeavours to preserve the Iroquese, tho' 
          the English of Virginia and Carolina are very much 
          incensed against them, and the French endeavour to 
          animate all the other English to the northward in the 
          same manner, as being a bloody, barbarous and 
          imperious people, at the same time that they them- 
          selves cajole them, and endeavour by all means to 
          make them their own. Yet their preservation seems 
          to be of vast importance to us. (ii) To encourage the 
          Government of Virginia to extend their settlements 
          beyond <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="indirect">the mountains</placeName>, over which the present 
          Governour has happily discovered passes, and to build 
          some forts on Lake Erie with the concurrence of the 
          Iroquese settled not far from thence : Colonel Spottiswood
          had this in view, till discouraged by the repeal 
          of their act for the Indian trade, the consequence of 
          which act 'tis doubted was not clearly enough understood, 
          (iii) To encourage and support the trade of 
          South Carolina who have very good opportunities of 
          making alliances with all the Indians to the southward 
          of the Lakes, and to the east of Missasippi. To which 
          their grant from the Crown gives them a very good 
          claim, (iv) To give such orders and instructions to 
          the Governours that they take special care of the 
          commerce with the Indians, that while they endeavour 
          to promote the trade of their own people, they shall 
          do nothing to weaken the interest of other Colonies 
          to which traders are too subject ; gain being their 
          only view. By these means all the Indians, with 
          whom we have any commerce, may be very much 
          united to the British interest, for the Indians being 
          supplied generally with better goods (excepting fire 
          arms, powder and some trinketts) and at easier rates 
          by the English than the French, they will choose to 
          deal with us rather than with them, and their interest 
          in this is commonly the strongest tie upon them. 
          The French indeed seem to exceed us in industry, and 
          in accommodating themselves to the humours of those 
          barbarous people, and they have now a vast number 
          of bold expert traders whom they call coureurs de bois, 
          who generally are as capable of the fatigues of long 
          journeys and fighting by ambush in the woods, the 
          common way of making war amongst them, as any 
          of the savages : Yet some of Virginia and Carolina 
          have shewn that they are scarce to be exceeded that way.

          Governor Hunter to the [? Duke of Newcastle]. Since 
          my last, a copie of which is inclos'd, the several companys of 
          two regiments have been sent to their respve. quarters where 
          it was judg'd they might be of most use, and barracks built, 
          where there are not finisht they are quarter'd by the parish'oners. 
          The private men are generally in good health and condition, 
          but of the officers, Major Brandreth, and Captn. Moloy of Coll. 
          Hayes, and Capt. Ballenden and Lieut. Sutton of Coll. Cope's 
          regiment are dead. That the service may not suffer, upon 
          application from the commanding officers, etc., I have order 'd 
          out commissions etc., detailed. Continues : The officers are 
          preferr'd according to their seniority and service, and I hope 
          H.M. will confirm their commissions. There are absent three 
          Captains and 7 subalterns. Our countrey party, consisting of 
          about 180 men were march'd from their place of rendezvous 
          before the regiments arriv'd. They had the luck to surprize 
          the chiefe negro setlement in the neighbourhood of <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName> 
          gott into the town with the loss of two men and a few wounded 
          the negro's set fire to that part of their town next to the 
          mountains and fled thither under the cover of the smoak. Our 
          party did not pursue but kept in the town three days and on 
          the fourth burnt it consisting of a hundred and six houses, and 
          retir'd to Port Antonio : I have order'd them immediately back 
          thither, if the officer finds them in good heart and willing, if 
          otherwise, to disband them : for they left it contrary to my 
          orders and have not taken one pris'ner. By the advice of the 
          Council and at the desire of the most substantial merchts. and 
          inhabitants, I have dissolv'd the Genll. Assembly, issu'd writts 
          for calling a new one, and our elections begin to-morrow. If 
          the gentlemen who desir'd the dissolution will exert themselves 
          we may hope for a better, but it can not well be worse : men of 
          desperate fortunes who want protection, and some of desperate 
          principles who want confusion will ever be the most active 
          and industrious to gett in but I hope the people's eyes

        <p>Mr. Fane to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Has no objection to five of the acts of <placeName ref="#jm" role="indirect">Jamaica</placeName>
          submitted to him, but as to the sixth, for the better regulating slaves etc., refers 
          to the objections stated in enclosed memorial, and concludes :
          Considering the circumstances of this family and the hardships 
          they must necessarily lye under in case this act passes into a 
          law : there ought at least to have been a particular exception 
          of them out of the act. But as that has not been provided for 
          I must submit it to your Lordships' consideration whether this 
          act ought to be confirmed. Signed, Fran. Fane. Endorsed,

          and traders of the <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="direct">City of London</placeName>, 
          to the King. There is a certain tract of land in 
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="direct">New York</placeName> containing 62,000 acres, commonly called the
          <placeName ref="#us_ny_putnam" role="direct">'Equivalent land'</placeName> because the same was formerly 
          taken from the <placeName ref="#us_ct" role="direct">Colony of Connecticut</placeName>, in lieu of the 
          like quantity yielded to that Colony by the Province 
          of New York upon the settling of their respective 
          boundarys, which tract of land is scituate between the 
          antient easterly bounds of New York upon the main 
          land, and the present westerly bounds of Connecticut, 
          bounded towards the north by the south line of the 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="boundary">Colony of the Massachusetts Bay</placeName> at about twenty 
          miles distance from <placeName ref="#rv_hudson" role="boundary">Hudsons River</placeName> etc. The said 
          tract hath never yet been granted to any person by 
          the Crown, but if the same were duly settled and 
          improved under a grant thereof from your Majesty, 
          it might be rendered greatly advantagious to this 
          Kingdom in the production of hemp, pitch, tarr, and 
          other kinds of naval stores, and is well scituated for 
          cultivating a furr trade with the Indian Nations in 
          that neighbourhood. Propose to settle it with 100 
          persons within 7 years and more as they find encouragement,
          and to pay 2s. 6d. per 100 acres, the same quit-
          rent as is reserved in all grants of lands in New York.

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. As I conceive no words can represent 
          the state of <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">this Island</placeName>, and 
          the conduct of the present General Assembly so clearly, and 
          justly, as their own votes, I have the honour of transmitting 
          them herewith to your Grace, from the first meeting of the 
          present General Assembly, to the 19th instant inclusive : this 
          last day of their meeting they passed a petition to H.M. upon 
          the subject matter of the report of the Committee appointed 
          to prepare a representation of their grievances, which report 
          is set down at large in their foregoing Minutes of the 15th of the 
          last month, but as to their petition I have not seen a copy of it. 
          The report setts forth the former petition made to H.M. against 
          me by the Assembly in 1728, which they now repeat again under
          pretence that they did not know that that petition had been 
          preferred to H.M., but they are informed, that it was transmitted to
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> in order to be preferred, but miscarryed for 
          want of proper Agents to sollicite the same. I was very much 
          surprised on reading these votes for I thought, it was notoriously 
          known, that it was not only preferr'd, but was order'd by H.M. 
          to be heard by the Lords for Trade etc. together with my answer, 
          and accordingly was heard, and the petition dismissed : but I 
          suppose this repetition of what they could not prove is to be 
          imposed upon the world, as an undoubted proof of the truth of 
          it. I can't help being amazed at their bold assertion in relation 
          to the conduct of the Gentlemen of H.M. Council here, who, 
          they say, " far from making the laws of the land, and the good 
          of their country the rule of their conduct, have acted of late, 
          as if they looked upon themselves indispensibly obliged to 
          concurr with H.E., in every attempt of his upon our liberties, 
          and properties ; " and in their foregoing votes of the 15th 
          of January last, they treat them as incendiaries. But whoever 
          considers the conduct of the Assembly for these three last years 
          in relation to the tax granted to H.M. for supporting the honour 
          and dignity of the Government, as well as by their own votes 
          would be apt to think that they accused the Council of what 
          they were guilty themselves. In their address to me they say 
          that if any deficiencies have happen'd in the collecting the tax, 
          the same " have proceeded from the miserable poverty of the 
          people, who thereby are forced to defend themselves against 
          the rigorous prosecutions, they are daily threatened with " etc. 
          (v. C.S.P. 27th Nov., 1730), and perhaps they may construe 
          any prosecution upon this head, as attempts upon their libertys, 
          and properties ; so that had H.M. Attorney General here prose- 
          cuted every one for H.M. tax who had not paid nor had given 
          in the number of his negro's to his representative or who had 
          not been returned by him a defaulter (for against these the 
          Treasurer by the law is not impower'd to issue his warrant 
          within four months after the time of payment, nor are these 
          persons after the said time discharged of the duty, but only 
          those against whom the law empowers the Treasurer to issue 
          his warrants, which has already been represented to H.M. in 
          the address of the Council) they might have called it a rigorous 
          prosecution, which would be a very absurd construction of the 
          law, as if any one's neglect, or refusal to deliver in the list of his 
          negro's as by the law he is obliged cou'd exempt him from the 
          duty, upon the whole I am most humbly of opinion that if an 
          order was sent to H.M. Attorney General here to sue every body 
          who had not paid their tax for these two last years, and against 
          whom the Treasurer is not empower'd by the law to issue his 
          warrants for the same, after a convenient limited time was 
          allowed them for the payment thereof, I am satisfied the country 
          would be soon quiet, for the people are daily expecting it, and
          say if this be the King's tax, and we ought to pay, how comes 
          it that there is not an order to oblige us to pay. In my letter 
          of 16th Jan. etc., I mentioned an expedient I could have wished 
          the Assembly would have come into, not that H.M. tax could 
          not have been recover'd by due course of law, but out of 
          tenderness to the inhabitants of this Island, for if H.M. Attorney 
          General here was to sue in the Exchequer every body that had 
          not paid his tax the expense of such a prosecution would fall 
          heavy especially on the poor people. Another insinuation in 
          the report is, that Mr. Webster holds the office of Secretary under 
          Francis Whitworth Esq. in trust for me, and therefore I had 
          recommended to the Assembly the fragment of what was due 
          to him, your Grace knows that what I did upon this head was 
          in obedience to H.M. orders in Council, not only for what was 
          due to my Lord Micklethwait and Mr. Whitworth, which was 
          from April 1714 to 1st March, 1726, but also for the future for 
          what ever shall become due to the Secretary for such services 
          as shall be performed by him for the publick. But your Grace 
          will observe by their votes of 19th instant how differently they 
          act in favour of their own officers, they there pass a petition to 
          me unanimously for the payment of 242£. 6s. 7d. for their Clerke, 
          tho' by their Minutes of the 4th Nov., 1729, his salary is settled 
          for the said year at 150£. and 50£. for publishing the votes in 
          the four towns of this Island. By the same annual proportion 
          there should be due to the Clerks of the Council from March, 
          1714 to 26th March, 1729, 3878£. Os. 4d., tho' their accounts 
          come to but 2823£. 16s. 9d. besides 300£., which was paid to Mr. 
          Lenoir a former Deputy Secretary, which would make the whole 
          sum 3123£. 16s. 9d. The report further sets forth, that of all 
          their grievances, that of the encrease of the French trade and 
          power is the greatest, and that it will be proper forthwith to 
          prepare an humble address to his most Gracious Majesty for 
          redress therein, and that accordingly a petition had been 
          presented, but, they say, they know too, that that petition had 
          been opposed at the Board of Trade by me and that my Agent 
          Mr. Sharpe was now opposeing the same ; what I have wrote 
          I thought it was my duty to do, I stated the facts truly, and 
          because Mr. Sharpe transacts my affairs in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>,
          is he to act for nobody else that will employ him ? And as it is notoriously           
          known that he is employed by one of the <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">Northern Colonys</placeName>, 
          a jealous mind might imagine, that this is mentioned to make 
          me odious to the inhabitants. As the Assembly, and they who 
          oppose the payment of H.M. tax have entertained of late great 
          hopes of Mr. Othniel Haggats being a Counsellor, tho' I could 
          say much upon that head, I need only refer your Grace to their 
          own votes by which your Grace will see the part that Gentleman 
          has acted. I dont know any two Gentlemen in the Island, that 
          have been more zealous against the payment of the King's tax, 
          than Mr. Ashley, and he etc. The Guarda da Costa of <placeName ref="#mq" role="direct">Martinico</placeName>
          about a month since went into <placeName ref="#lc_carenage" role="direct">the Carnache</placeName>, a port in
          <placeName ref="#lc" role="indirect">Sta. Lucia</placeName>, where vessells generally resort to carry on a clandestine 
          trade with the French inhabitants of Martinico, and meeting 
          with a great many English vessells, he seized them all, as soon 
          as I was informed of it, I wrote to the Governor of Martinico, 
          that he would restore them, but I have not yet his answer ; 
          however there is a report, that they were condemn'd in the 
          Admiralty Court there, from whence they had appealed to the 
          Governour and Council. I must observe upon this head that 
          some time before this accident happen'd a French Guarda da 
          Costa went in there, and one of the English vessells that were 
          there, fired at her, and lodged a shot in her bow, upon which 
          he return'd to Martinico to make his complaint, and the next 
          day a French man of war was sent thither, but not finding the 
          vessell, which had fired at the Guarda da Costa, he returned 
          without injuring any that were there etc. Encloses duplicate

        <p>Mr. Fane to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          In reply to Queries of Jan. 12th, is of opinion (i) that the powers 
          given to the Fishing Admirals and the civil magistrates are 
          entirely distinct ; The Fishing Admirals have no powers but what 
          arise from the Act of the 10th and 11th of K. William III and 
          those confined to the fishing, and the Justices can no more 
          interfere with them in regard to such powers, than the fishing 
          Admirals can interfere with the Justices in the powers given 
          them by their commission, (ii) That the former have no power 
          to send warrants to the constables or commit to prison or the 
          stocks. They are indeed by said Act directed to see that law 
          put in execution, but there is no power to be given by that law 
          to levy penalties or inflict punishments. The want of it, is 
          certainly a defect etc. Thinks the Fishing Admirals are sub- 
          ordinate to the Justices in everything but what relates to their 
          fishing authority, (iii) " I apprehend that aU the statute laws 
          made here previous to H.M. subjects settling in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName> 
          are in force there : it being a settlement in an infidel country : 
          and as to the laws passed here subsequent to the settlement, 
          I take it they will not extend to this country unless it is particu- 
          larly mentioned, (iv) I do not think the Governour himself 
          can act as Justice of the Peace, for I observe the power from His 
          Majestic is only to appoint fit persons for the administration 
          of Justice." Signed, Fran. Fane. Endorsed, Reed. 30th March,

        <p>Petition of Jacob Stauber, John Ocks, Ezekiel Harlan and Thomas Gould 
          to the Council of Trade and Plantations. Stauber and Harlan have lived 
          upwards of 20 years in <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="direct">Pennsilvania</placeName>
          following husbandry of which they have a perfect understanding.
          Stauber lately took a journey into <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">[? Virgin]ia</placeName>
          on purpose to make a search after some uninhabited land behind 
          <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="indirect">the mountains of that Province</placeName>, which are above 30 miles over,
          and but one place fit for a road. After he had passed these
          mountains with much pains, great difficulty and hazard of life,
          without any company or seeing any Indians in all his travels,
          he spent three months time to view the soyl and situation of
          the land lying westward to the said mountains towards
          <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="indirect">Missisipy river</placeName>, which land he found to be good pasture ground
          fitt for planting of vineyards on the side of the mountains, and 
          a very good soyle for hemp, flax, and all sorts of grain, a proper 
          climate [? to prod]uce silk and a good prospect to make salt 
          petre and potash. Your Lordships are doubtless fully perswaded
          that it will be a great importance to the Crown and 
          interest of the Nation that these Dominions may be enlarged 
          beyond the mountains to the West for the following considerations: 
          If it is neglected to extend the bounds of Great Britain 
          beyond the mountains to the west, it is probable that the French 
          in a short time may take possession thereof. In settling a 
          colony beyond these mountains extending as [? far] as the river 
          of Missisipy, the French settlements of Missisipy and <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName>
          would thereby be prevented to join together, as their intention 
          is, which will be of great prejudice to this Kingdom. The 
          strength of the subjects of this Kingdom in America would be 
          considerably encreased by carrying over a great number of 
          Germans and Swiss Protestants who will be chiefly such as can 
          provide for themselves at [? their own]n charge, which are also 
          reputed to be a good Militia. This colony would be obliged to 
          apply themselves chiefly by reason of the distant land carriage 
          upon such productions as are very much desired in this Kingdom, 
          vizt., hemp, flax, silk, potash, salt petre, with other valuable 
          commodities in which the Germans and Swissers are particularly 
          skilled in (except the silk), the expectation of which commodities 
          from other colonies [? has been] hitherto not answered, it would 
          also considerably augment our trade by consuming a good 
          quantity of the manufacture of this Kingdom, and employ 
          m[?uch ship]ping etc. Pray the Board to recommend the 
          Government to grant them a joint patent of a free grant of a 
          tract of land to begin at the <placeName ref="#mt_doubletop" role="direct">Double Top Mountain</placeName> by
          <placeName ref="#rv_hawksbill" role="direct">Hawks Bill Creek</placeName> including the mountains through which the road 
          is to be made, to go thence northwards in a line to the border 
          of Pensilvania and behind the same, to make the whole breadth 
          200 miles, thence in a straight line to the Missisipy etc. 
          Petitioners undertake the settlement of this colony without 
          any charge to the Government, which hitherto no person has 
          attempted to undertake etc. Will make a road 30 miles long 
          through the mountains, and for security against the Indians 
          will purchase the land and friendship of them with considerable 
          presents etc. " Being so far separated from Virginia, by the 
          mountains 'tis humbly desired that it may be a separate Colony 
          and Government under the [? na]me of Georgia. Stauber, who 
          has employed much time and expences in searching out this 
          land and making a voyage hither, prays for a speedy decision, 
          intending to go without delay to <placeName ref="#de" role="indirect">Germany</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#ch" role="indirect">Switzerland</placeName> to 
          get people to go with them to Virginia etc. Endorsed, Recd.,

          Mr. Popple to Mr. Burchett. Encloses Heads of Enquiry which the Admiralty 
          are desired to give as Instructions to Capt. Waterhouse of H.M.S. Winchelsea
          appointed to guard the Fishery at <placeName ref="#ca_ns_canso" role="direct">Canso</placeName>. Annexed,
          113. i. Heads of Enquiry for Capt. Waterhouse. You are 
          to give all due encouragement and protection to the 
          trade and fishery at Canso, and transmit the fullest 
          account you can get thereof etc., as likewise distinct 
          answers to the following queries, (i) Whether the 
          inhabitants are possessed of any stages, cook-rooms 
          etc. or of any trainfats ? if so, by what title or whether 
          they are left at large for fishing ships ? (ii) Whether 
          any persons do presume to expunge, cut out, deface or 
          alter the mark of any boats or trainfats of other 
          persons and convert them to their own use or remove 
          the same from the places they were left in by the 
          owners ? (iii) By what people is the Fishery carried 
          on ? And whether any strangers or aliens do resort 
          to <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName> or the Islands adjacent thereunto and 
          take bait or use any sort of trade or fishing whatsoever 
          in those parts ? (iv) Whether the said Inhabitants 
          are wholly supplied with sail cloth, nets and tackle for 
          their fishery, and with woollen, linnen, leather and 
          other manufactures, for their use ard wear, from
          <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">this Kingdom</placeName>?
          Or from the Plantations or any foreign 
          country ? (v) What wages do the inhabitants allow 
          to their servants for carrying on the Fishery ? And 
          in what manner do they pay them ? (vi) How much 
          the charge of fitting out and maintaining one of their 
          fishing boats, for the whole season amounts to ? (vii) 
          What number of inhabitants are settled near the coast 
          where the Fishery is carried on ? What share have 
          they in the Fishery ? And how they employ them- 
          selves during the remainder of the year ? (viii) 
          Whether the houses, buildings and inclosures of the 
          inhabitants are at such a distance from the water side 
          as not to hinder or obstruct the fishermen in making 
          their flakes, or in drying and curing their fish ? (ix) 
          How many flakes are allowed to each fishing boat and 
          of what length ? Whether they are extended in length 
          according to the custom used in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="secondary">Newfoundland</placeName>
          from the shore up into the land ? Or whether any of the 
          inhabitants or fishermen extend their flakes along 
          shore or possess a larger front to the water side according
          to the number of their boats than was formerly 
          allowed at Newfoundland in that case ? (x) Whether 
          the fishing ships that proceed directly from this 
          Kingdom to Nova Scotia are victualled here and 
          provided with all other necessaries of British product 
          and manufacture for the whole voyage ? Or whether 
          the masters of freighters do not furnish themselves 
          with provisions that are brought from the Plantations 
          or other parts to Nova Scotia ? (xi) Whether any of 
          the fishing ships pursue or follow the old laudable 
          custom of allowing their ships' company shares of 
          what they make in the voyage instead of wages, and 
          in such case how much doth the change of fitting out 
          and maintaining a ship of one hundred with fifty men 
          and ten boats amount to for the whole voyage ? (xii) 
          How many taverns or publick houses for entertainment 
          may there be kept in Nova Scotia or at least in the 
          harbour of Canso ? Are they kept only by the 
          inhabitants or by the people of <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="indirect">New England</placeName>? 
          Also do they trust the fishermen upon their own credit or 
          do the masters of the ships permit them to trust their 
          crews and deduct the same out of their respective 
          wages, hire or shares in order to satisfy the said tavern 
          keepers ? Are not the poor seamen hereby tempted 
          to spend the greatest part or the full amount of their 
          wages, and frequently run so far in debt, that they 
          are forced to remain as servants to the inhabitants, 
          and at last constrain'd to betake themselves to New 
          England ? (xiii) Whether the inhabitants do not 
          usually trust their own servants employ'd in the 
          Fishery with rum and other stores to a greater value 
          than their wages amount to ? And whether they are 
          not generally paid in the manner as in the foregoing 
          article ? (xiv) Whether the New England traders do 
          still continue to entice and carry thither numbers of 
          handicraft men, seamen and fishermen ? And whether 
          any of the inhabitants do favour or assist them therein. 
          Continues : And whereas H.M. Consuls and the merchants residing in 
          <placeName ref="#pt" role="secondary">Portugal</placeName>, <placeName ref="#es" role="secondary">Spain</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#it" role="secondary">Italy</placeName> unanimously complain,
          that by reason of the ill curing of fish for some years past the consumption thereof is 
          considerably lessen'd and that the trade will be lost 
          if effectual care be not taken to reform the same, you 
          are therefore to use your best endeavours that the 
          masters of the fishing ships and inhabitants do take 
          the greatest care in curing their fish with good salt, 
          and with a sufficient quantity and in preparing, 
          husbanding and ordering the same that the credit 
          thereof may be again recovered and esteemed in the 
          several places for which it is carried for sale. And 
          further upon this occasion you are very particularly 
          to inquire into their manner and method of taking 
          and curing their fish, what quantity of salt they allow 
          for curing 100 quintals ? Whether they are guilty 
          of any abuse in the ordering thereof ? Whether the 
          fish taken at a distance from the land by their small 
          vessels, is not prejudiced before it is brought on shore ? 
          Whether the inhabitants or the fishing ships are most 
          to be blamed ? And in short from whence these 
          complaints arise ? And what methods are to be taken 
          to prevent or rectify whatsoever is amiss ? You are 
          also to enquire into the present state of the French 
          Fishery at Canso and <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="direct">Cape Breton</placeName>, What number of 
          ships, boats and men they employ therein ? Whether 
          they do not encourage Irish Papists who are disaffected 
          to our present happy establishment and what number 
          of such may now be among the French. And to send 
          the best account you can of their strength number and 
          trade. You are farther to enquire whether any of the 
          Officers of the garrison at Canso are concerned directly 
          or indirectly by themselves or others in the Fishery ? 
          Or whether they take upon them to dispose of fishing 
          rooms, beaches, stages etc. to any person whatsoever 
          or hire out the soldiers to fish. Annexed,

          Continues : The elections are not as yet over, but so far as they are gone 
          I think matters are mended. Capt. Dent who is to leave us in ten days will cary with him
          the acts pass'd last session, with the minutes and journals of 
          Council and Assembly. Last Supreme Court in Feb. one

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Governor Johnson.
          We have received your letter of the 27th of December last,
          with the old broad Seal of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="direct">South Carolina</placeName>,
          and take this opportunity of congratulating you upon your safe arrival in 
          your Government, where we hope that by your prudent conduct 
          and behaviour, all those unhappy disputes and divisions which 
          have so much disturbed the publick tranquility of the Province, 
          may soon be settled. We are very glad that ye seven Cherrokee 
          Indian Chiefs are well satisfied with the treatment they receiv'd 
          whilst in <placeName ref="#en" role="direct">England</placeName>; as it will be the means of continuing a 
          lasting peace with the Indian nations bordering on your 
          Government. Mr. Lowndes, the Provost Marshal of your 
          Province, having again apply'd to us against ye act for the 
          better settling of the Courts of Justice in South Carolina, passed 
          there by Mr. Middleton in 1726, we take this opportunity of 
          mentioning to you our objections, that you may get another 
          act pass'd not lyable thereto. This Act alters the first process 
          in civil actions from a summons to a capias ; but as in our 
          Law-process, a summons is always suppos'd to be made in the 
          first instance, we think this part of the law ought to be amended 
          and a summons instituted instead of the capias, and the 
          rather, as it will be the least expensive way of proceeding and 
          ye most speedy to obtain justice By another clause in this 
          law we observe the Provost Marshal is obliged to give security 
          for the due performance of his Office ; but as the Provost 
          Marshal seldom resides in Carolina, we think it will be more 
          adviseable to oblige the Deputy to give security, or to mention 
          it in general terms that who ever shall personally execute that 
          office, shall be obliged to give security. As we have no objection 
          to the other parts of this Law, they may be re-enacted again, 
          but you must take care, to insert in the new law a clause to 
          suspend its taking effect till approved by H.M. We hope 
          shortly to receive some account of ye affairs under your 
          managemt. [C.O. 5, 401. pp. 17, 18.]</p>

          of the <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">Bahama Islands</placeName> thereto as soon as possible,

          to the queries of the Board of Trade, (i) Lond., 3rd April, 
          1731. The present Lessees have never granted any 
          lands nor given any authorities for granting of lands 
          but by letters, and they have never had any 
          information of any lands having been granted 
          pursuant to those letters, (ii) v. Sept. 9th. (iii) 
          They value their interest at 20,000£., having paid to 
          the old Lessees 20,000£. for the fortifications, and 
          other improvements made by them in, and they having 
          since expended in that work and in sending over 
          inhabitants, provisions and stores 20,000£. more and 
          upwards, and it is apprehended there are several 
          million of acres of land yet unsett. (iv) v. Sept. 9th. 
          (v) 700£. is due to the Lords Proprietors for arrears of 
          rent. N.B. The present Lessees have also expended 
          great sums in dislodging of pirates, defending the 
          islands from the Spaniards, of which accounts have 
          formerly been laid before the Lords Commissioners 
          for Trade, and the great importance these islands are

          Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and Plantations.
          Has taken all the care he could to prepare answers to queries. 
          Acknowledges letters of 1st Dec. and 12th Feb. last. 
          Refers to his letters of 7th Oct. and 10th Dec. etc.
          Continues : I am sorry I have occasion to say to your Lordships 
          this new Assembly have still gone backward, and seem resolv'd 
          to do nothing more [as to the Governor's salary] than they did 
          about forty years agoe when the form of government they are 
          now under was first erected, tho' I have left no stone unturn'd 
          to bring them to a sense of their duty. I can't help covering 
          to your Lordships what has been printed <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">here</placeName> out of the Decr. 
          Political State. Who was the vile authour I know not ; the 
          unreasonable ill nature at me is glaring, but I think there is a 
          strong implication of rudeness and ill manners to his most 
          Excellent Majesty and his Ministers, and it has been printed 
          here to poison H.M. subjects as much as possible and has 
          obtain'd the desir'd effect at present so far as to make this 
          Assembly (to use the authour's compliment upon them), more 
          obstinate in their refusal of complying with H.M. Instruction. 
          I think it's a pity but that the authour of the Political State 
          should be punisht according to his demerits. Notwithstanding 
          this villanous libel your Lordships will see by the Journals I 
          inclose (from the last sent you) my Speech to the Assembly, 
          and I still hope. Nothing shall make me swerve from my 
          royal Master's honour and interest. Your Lordships say you 
          should wait my next letters before you make yr. report to 
          H.M. upon this subject, which letters of mine I find were arriv'd 
          before the ships came away by which your Lordships wrote 
          me. I think it my duty to say to your Lordships that I have 
          at present no expectation of this Assembly's doing anything 
          in complyance with H.M. Instruction. They must rise in a 
          few days and I shall then transmit to your Lordships what 
          more may occur, and conformable to the Royal Charter, I shall 
          issue writs for a new Assembly 26 instant and keep your 
          Lordships duly acquainted with all my proceedings. Upon 
          my arrival I directed the King's Secretary to send your 
          Lordships under the seal of the Province at the end of every 
          session all the laws to which I gave my assent and this he tells 
          me he faithfully observes. In your Lordships' letter of 1 
          Deer, you seem to fault me that you had seen the printed 
          votes of the Assembly to that time from another hand, I must 
          ask pardon of your Lordships if I made any slip on this head. 
          I am sure it was not from any want of respect, but rather the 
          contrary, least I should trouble you with too many letters 
          onely to cover the House's Journals de die in diem : But I 
          thought if I sent them at the end of every session, they would 
          be more compleat, and more acceptable to yr. Lordships. Yet 
          if you would have me practice otherwise for the future I shall 
          (on your notice) duly observe it etc. Adds to denial of his 
          intending a military expedition against <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's Fort</placeName>
          the further confirmation that he did not keep or demolish it when 
          Hamilton, who called himself Col. Dunbar's Lieutenant, upon 
          sight of the King's Sheriffe (with his posse) deserted the fort, 
          and ran into the woods like a lusty fellow etc. Begs to be served 
          with a copy of any complaint before proceedings are taken 
          upon it etc. P.S. I should take it as a favour for the future, 
          that your Lordships would commit the care of your letters for 
          me to Francis Wilks Esq., they will always then come to me in 
          great safety. Signed, J. Belcher. Endorsed, Recd. 21st May,

        <p>Extract from the Political State of Great Britain for 
          the month of December, 1730. Abstract : The people 
          of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts Bay</placeName> continue in their refusal of 
          complying with H.M. Instructions for appointing a 
          fixed salary upon their Governors. Governor Belcher 
          insists as strongly as ever any Governor did upon 
          their complying, although he was formerly positive 
          against it and was the person sent over by them to 
          oppose any measures for such a settlement etc. Most 
          of the Council it seems think differently for the 
          Assembly. Quotes Governor's Speech to Council and 
          Assembly 2nd Oct., 1730 ; urging a settlement, 
          quoting the Board of Trade's report on the subject 
          in 1723, and reminding them that their disputes with 
          the Crown have already cost them over 50,000£. 
          From his experience as Agent assures them that 
          nothing prevented a Parliamentary proceeding against 
          them last winter, but the King being willing to give 
          them one more opportunity to show their duty and 
          gratitude by doing what is so just and reasonable. 
          Has the strongest persons to fear that they have " so 
          few friends among the King's Ministers, or in either 
          House of Parliament, as that a proceeding in a way 
          the King says, your final non-compliance must bring 
          it to, will bring into the utmost hazard every thing 
          that is dear to the people of this country " etc. Quotes 
          letters from Mr. Belcher and Mr. Wilks, Oct. 24, 1729 
          and 1st May, 1730, and Governor Belcher's Speech 
          to the Representatives, 16th Oct., 1730. The author 
          concludes : I am perswaded that these Gentlemen 
          of the House of Representatives, who are so resolute 
          against the commands of the Crown, have the honour 
          and interest of their native country, and the liberties 
          and properties of those they represent nearly at heart, 
          otherwise they would never make such a stand against 
          Royal Power, which has now so many ways of 
          rewarding its humble servants, and so large a scope 
          for punishing its opposers etc. The Assembly resembles 
          our Parliaments in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, the Governor represents 
          the King and the Council the Lords, and every member 
          of our Parliament would hear with disdain the threats 
          and expressions in Governor Belcher's Speech and 
          Message, " terms more proper for a French 
          Monarch, or a Turkish Bashaw than for an English 
          Governor " etc. As His Majesty "is so gracious, 
          that he ever desired to be independent of his 
          Parliament, I cannot think that he ever desired 
          that any of his Governors should be independent of 
          the people, they are sent to rule over. . . I am 
          perswaded that his Majesty has so great a regard for 
          the liberties of his people, that he will not give the least 
          handle for oppressing them in any part of his Dominions, 
          nor be disobliged by any man who delivers his 
          sentiments bravely and freely " etc. When any King 
          allows himself to be lulled asleep by putting a stop to 
          informations through the liberty of speech and the 
          Press, he is in danger of being himself involved in a 
          ruin, which was at first only designed against his 
          Ministers. Nor is a standing army of any effect in 
          such circumstances. The dispute in <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="indirect">New England</placeName> 
          is of the more weight, because it is one of the best and 
          most powerful Colonies we have in the <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="secondary">West Indies</placeName>. 
          Oppression and arbitrary sway generally take their 
          rise in the most remote parts of a nation. For that 
          reason, he is particularly interested in New England, 
          " because I am afraid it should one time or other serve 
          as a precedent at Home." Enclosed, Recd. 31st May, 1731. Printed. 16 pp.</p>

        <p>Governor Belcher's answers to the queries sent from the Council of Trade 
          and Plantations, relating to <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>.
          <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="from">Portsmouth, N.H.</placeName>, 25th March, 1731. 
          i-iii Describes situation, boundaries and constitution. 
          (iv) The Trade is lumber and fish. The number of 
          shipping belonging to the Province are five consisting 
          of about 500 tons, and there are about 3 or 400 tons 
          of other shipping that trade here annually. Seafaring 
          men, about 40. The trade is much the same as it 
          hath been for ten years past. (v) The Province 
          makes use of all sorts of Brittish manufactures, 
          amounting to about 5000£. sterling pr. annum, which 
          are had principally from <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName>. (vi) The trade to 
          other Plantations is to the <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="indirect">Caribbee Islands</placeName>, whither 
          we send lumber and fish, and receive for it rum, sugar, 
          molasses and cotton. The trade to <placeName ref="#europe" role="indirect">Europe</placeName>, is to 
          <placeName ref="#es" role="secondary">Spain</placeName> or <placeName ref="#pt" role="secondary">Portugal</placeName>
          in the above mentioned commodities, from whence our vessels bring home salt, (vii) The 
          method appointed to prevent illegal trade is by a 
          Collector appointed at home, (viii) The natural 
          produce is timber, principally oak, pine, hemlock, 
          ash, beech and birch and fish, and they are the only 
          commodities of the place. The timber is generally 
          manufactur'd into beams, plank, knees, boards, 
          clap-boards, shingle and staves, and sometimes into 
          house-frames ; the value annually exported to Europe 
          and the West India Islands, is about 1000£. sterling. 
          Mem. Besides what is above mentioned, the coasting 
          sloops from Boston carry from hence thither in fish 
          and timber about 5000£. per annum, (ix) No mines 
          yet discovered except a small quantity of iron ore in 
          two or three places, (x) Inhabitants, about 10,000 
          whites and 200 blacks, (xi) They are increased about 
          4000 this ten years last past, 1000 of which (at least) 
          are people from <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName> lately come into and settled 
          in the Province. Another reason of the increase of 
          late more than formerly, is a peace with the Indians 
          the four last years, (xii) The Militia, about 1800, 
          consists of two regiments of foot with a troop of horse 
          in each, (xiii) There is one fort or place of defence 
          called <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">Fort William and Mary</placeName>, situate on
          <placeName ref="#is_newcastle" role="direct">the great island in Newcastle</placeName>, which commands the entrance of 
          <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="direct">Piscataqua river</placeName>, but is in poor low circumstances, 
          much out of repair, and greatly wanting stores of war, 
          there not being one barrel of gunpowder at this time 
          there, (xiv) There are no Indians in this Province 
          now in time of peace (xv), nor in the neighbourhood, except in 
          <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">the Eastern parts of the Massachusetts Bay</placeName>,
          and their number and strength we are not 
          acquainted with, (xvi) No neighbouring Europeans
          except French who are extreamly numerous at <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="indirect">Cape Briton</placeName> etc. (xvii) The effect which the 
          French settlements have on this Province is, that 
          the Indians are frequently instigated and influenced 
          by them to disturb the peace and quiet of this Province, 
          we having been often put to a vast expence both of 
          blood and treasure to defend ourselves against their 
          outrages, (xviii) The revenue is 396£ by excise, 
          which is appropriated towards the Governor's salary, 
          and three or four barrels of gunpowder from the 
          shipping, which is spent at the Fort, there is no other 
          revenue but by tax on polls and estates. (xix) 
          Ordinary expense of the Government is about 1500£. 
          etc. Extraordinary and contingent charges as repairs 
          of the Fort, powder etc. about 500£. more. (xx) The 
          establishments are 600£. salary on the Governor, 8s. 
          per diem on each Councillor, and 6s. per diem on each 
          Representative during the session of General Assembly, 
          and 150£. per annum on the officers and soldiers at the 
          Fort. There is no other establishment, civil or 
          military, but the Assembly make allowances from 
          time to time as they see meet to the Treasurer, 
          Secretary etc. The Judges, Justices, Sheriffs, Clerks 
          and all other officers fees are fix'd by a law to be paid 
          by the parties whom they serve, but they have nothing 
          out of the Treasury. All the officers, civil and military, 
          hold their places by commission from the Governor 
          except the Councillors appointed by the King, the 
          Recorder of deeds chosen by the General Assembly, 
          the Clerks of Courts nominated by the Judges of the 
          said Courts respectively, and select men, assessors, 
          constables, tithing men and other town officers chosen 
          by the towns at their respective town meetings.

          might be highly essential to the wellfare of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britton</placeName>,
          and to the Cherokee Nation, and would cause 
          such a mutual union between both Nations, that their

          the climate of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="direct">Carolina</placeName> is suited to produce raw silk,

        <p>Sir William Keith to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. I have in obedience to your Lordships' commands 
          examined the above etc., and I am humbly of opinion, that 
          H.M. may be advised to pass such a grant etc. (i) Because 
          until some such settlement be actually made by a numerous 
          active people from behind <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="direct">the Great Mountains</placeName> all along to 
          the <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="direct">River Messussippi</placeName>,
          I conceive it will be impossible to prevent 
          foreigners from setling those rich lands in the middle of
          <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">the Continent</placeName> which undoubtedly belong to the Crown of Britain 
          and the possession whereof are absolutely necessary to secure 
          and defend from future danger the valuable colonies already 
          setled on the coast and on this side the mountains, (ii) Because 
          such an improvement or inlet to a trade with the numerous native 
          Indians on <placeName ref="#lk_great" role="indirect">the Lakes</placeName> and the branches of the Messussippi will 
          give a new and large vent to the exportation of course woolings 
          and other British manufactures fit for the traffick which is 
          continually decaying at present in all the Colonies on this side
          the mountains, the game there being wasted and the Indians 
          reduced to a very small number. (iii) Because when this 
          Colony is settled etc., it will infallibly raise the vast tracts of 
          lands on each side as far West as the banks of the Messussippi 
          to a considerable value which without such a settlement can 
          never be of any use to the Crown of Britain, but on the contrary 
          will be a prey to foreigners and a continual annoyance to the 
          Colonies on this side the mountains, (iv) Because the European 
          market etc. seems to be overcharged with the present product 
          of our Colonies on the main such as tobacco, rice, corn etc. 
          which forces the people into trifling manufactures of their own, 
          and discourages or lessens the exportations from Great Britain, 
          whereas by the settlement proposed where the people can have 
          no access to navigation a new scene is open'd for the produce 
          of silk, hemp, flax, potash, wines etc. ; besides the vast extent 
          of Indian trade already mention'd. (v) Because there is no prospect of ever making such a settlement 
          by slow degrees with such a handfull of people as can be spared 
          at any one time from <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> or
          <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName>, and therefore it is adviseable by such 
          a grant as this to tempt or induce a large body of foreigners to 
          bring over their effects and subject themselves in this manner 
          to the Dominion of Britain, under which no doubt they will 
          rejoyce to feel the happy effects of a resonable freedom, (vi) 
          Because this settlement and the improvment of the lands being 
          to be carried on at the general expence of the setlers themselves 
          and not out of the estates of the persons to be named in the 
          patent, the success will probably depend on its being evidently 
          the interest of the patentees to invite the setlers on much easier 
          terms than would in all likelihood be obtain'd from persons of 
          overgrown estates and opulent fortunes, for it is a certain truth 
          that where large quantitys of land in America have fallen into 
          the hands of such proprietors they have been rarely sought 
          after and commonly very slow in improvement besides persons 
          of a low degree in life who are known amongst their equals to 
          be morally honest and industrious will sooner perswade a 
          multitude into a voluntary expedition of this nature than those 
          of greater wealth and higher rank who are ever liable to the 
          suspicion and jealousy of the vulgar, (vii) Because let the 
          patentees in such a case be men of what condition or estate you 
          please, the only security which the Crown can depend on is a 
          limitation in the patent that the lands shall actually be setled 
          in a certain time or the grant shall be void and from the nature 
          and scituation of the place proposed if 100 familys once sit 
          down there will be no room to apprehend any loss or ill 
          consequences from such a beginning. (viii) Because if this 
          proposition should be rejected at this time, it is uncertain 
          whether an application of the like nature made by foreigners 
          to the Court of <placeName ref="#fr" role="secondary">France</placeName> would not readily be accepted perhaps 
          on terms not very agreeable to the interest of Great Britain.

          Governor Hunter to the Council of Trade and Plantations.
          Encloses duplicate of 11th Feb. etc. Continues: 
          The several resolutions of the Assembly in the said letter 
          mention'd have since that been pass'd into four acts, transmitted 
          herewith, vizt. : (i) An act for raising several sums of money 
          and applying the same to several uses. This act is commonly 
          call'd the Additional duty bill and varies little in substance 
          from the annual bills which usually passes under the same 
          title, only in this particular, that they have rais'd the duty 
          upon the import, and export of negroes from ten shillings pr. 
          head to fifteen in the former, and from twenty shillings pr. 
          head to thirty on the latter, (ii) An act for raising a tax by the 
          poll, and on trades, offices and rents. In this act 12d. per head 
          is laid upon every negro and 3d. pr. head upon all cattle, horses, 
          mares, asses and mules, and the trades, offices and rents are 
          taxed as usual. It is computed that this bill will raise about 
          6000£., and it is appropriated intirely for an additional sub- 
          sistance to the officers and soldiers of H.M. two Regiments, 
          (iii) An act to oblige the several inhabitants to provide themselves 
          with sufficient number of white people, or pay certain sums of money 
          in case they shall be deficient, and for laying a duty upon shipping 
          the same to several uses. This act is what is commonly call'd 
          our Deficiency bill, and the deficiency being 26£. the same as 
          last year, it is believed the inhabitants will rather chuse to keep 
          their complement of white men and women than pay so high 
          a tax ; if so this bill will raise but little money. The duty 
          upon shipping has been inserted in former bills, but generally 
          appropriated to the repairing the walls at <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName>;
          in this bill it is given as well as the deficiency for an additional
          subsistence to the two Independent Companys, and the 
          overplus (if any) to such other uses as the Assembly shall direct, 
          (iv) An act for appropriating and applying money for the 
          additional subsistence of the officers and soldiers of the two regiments 
          arrived and for other uses, and ascertaining the voluntary rewards 
          to be allowed for the services they perform, and to oblige such parishes 
          as have not already made up their accompts and paid their arrears 
          to do the same in a prefixed time. This act appropriates all the 
          money arising by the three acts abovemention'd and not already 
          appropriated for and towards an additional subsistence to the 
          two Regiments etc., each Commissioned Officer resident on the 
          Island 20s. pr. week, to each private man 5s. pr. week, the 
          Officers' pay to commence from the day of their landing here, 
          and the private men's to take place so soon as the King's 
          provisions they brought with them should be expended, the 
          additional subsistance to continue only for six months and no 
          longer, tho' the fund be for one whole year this bill ; this bill 
          also obliges the parishes where the troops are or shall be sent 
          to provide good and convenient barracks, and allotts 12 negroes 
          to attend each company to be allow'd and paid for by the 
          Church Wardens of such parishes where the troops are quartered, 
          and a reward of 10£. is given for each rebellious negro the soldiers 
          shall either kill or take alive ; there is also in this bill two small 
          appropriations of 150£. and 100£. which the publick stood 
          engaged for, and the Council making no objections to this bill 
          nor the other three, I gave my consent to them, and finding the 
          Assembly not in a disposition to enter upon any other business 
          I did at their own request grant them a recess. On 2nd March 
          I summon'd a Council who gave it as their unanimous opinion 
          that the Assembly should be dissolved, which [I] did accordingly 
          by proclamation ; the chief motives which induced me to joyn 
          in opinion with them are, that this Assembly had already sat 
          three years, that in this last session great heats and disputes 
          arose about allowing an additional subsistance to the troops, 
          in so much that it was all that the friends of the Government 
          could obtain in the House to provide for them for six months 
          to which the words "and no longer" were added, and tho' I had 
          so often recommended to this Assembly several very material 
          things for the wellfare of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Country</placeName>, such as the better settling 
          the uncultivated lands, and giving due encouragement to white 
          people to become inhabitants, and to consider on some proper 
          measures to regain credit (now almost at a stop) and to establish 
          the value of our coin, yet they neglected doing any thing upon 
          those heads, tho' apparently for their own good. The merchants 
          began to be uneasie, and as I am credibly inform'd wish'd for 
          a disolution, so that I acquiest in giving the country a new 
          choice. Writts were accordingly issued for calling a new 
          Assembly to meet on the fourth of May, and the elections are 
          just over and by what I can guess I hope we shall have a better 
          disposed Assembly, there are more merchants in it than in the 
          last and about one half are new Members, tho' several of the 
          old who were there before meerly for protection have by their 
          industry got in again, etc. Encloses Minutes of Council to 9th 
          March, and Journals of the Council and of the late Assembly, 
          " but as there is nothing of great moment in them, I shall not 
          trouble your Lordships with any particular observations." 
          Continues : The troops are gone to the several parishes to be 
          barrack'd as the Act directs, and I hope in a short time they 
          will be better reconciled to their quarters, the Gentlemen of 
          fortune in the Island being very kind to them. They write me 
          from <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, where Admiral Stewart now is,
          that all the troops there are in perfect health, and considering the infancy 
          of that settlement pritty well accommodated. Since Capt. 
          Peters's party who burnt the negro town were disbanded, the 
          rebellious slaves have made incurtions upon some of the out 
          settlements which makes me believe that they are dispersing 
          themselves into small bodys. I shall take all possible care to 
          make the troops usefull and to encourage the country voluntary 
          partys to pursue them. By the last advices from <placeName ref="#pa_portobello" role="direct">Porto Bello</placeName>
          we have an account that the Fair was to begin about the latter 
          end of this month, that there was a great deal of money already 
          arrived from <placeName ref="#pe_lima" role="indirect">Lima</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#pa" role="indirect">Panama</placeName> and more hourly expected, 
          and that it was generally believed the cargo of the <placeName ref="#pacific" role="secondary">South Sea</placeName>
          ship Prince William would come to a very great market, etc.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Committee 
          of the Privy Council. Reply to 14th April. The Council of 
          <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> has usually consisted of twelve members and no more, 
          which number is at present compleat ; But if H.M. shall think 
          proper upon this occasion to augmt. that number to thirteen 
          and to reduce it again upon the first vacancy that shall occur, 
          we have no objection thereunto. But in case your Lordps. 
          should not be of opinion to advise H.M. to augment the 
          number of his Council in Jamaica, he may notwithstanding 
          restore Mr. Ayscough to his ancient rank either immediately 
          or upon his arrival in Jamaica, giving orders at the same 
          time that the youngest Councillor be suspended from sitting

          and Instructions for Governor Clinton. Continue : 
          These draughts are copied from those which were 
          given to Capt. Osborn, 1729 etc., with the addition of 
          the two last articles in the Instructions only, by the 
          first of which Capt. Clinton is directed to enquire what 
          effect has attended the Commission given to his 
          predecessor for creating Justices of Peace and other 
          Civil Officers ; how those Officers have behaved 
          themselves in the execution of their trust, whether 
          the people have paid due obedience to their authority, 
          or what obstructions have been given thereto. By 
          the other article directions are given for framing a

          representations to your Majesty. [C.O. 195, 7. pp. 259-261.]</p>

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. It is his 
          duty and honour to acquaint his Grace with the affairs of 
          his Government. Hopes that his letters of Jan. 23 will acquit 
          him from Col. Dunbar's false complaint. Col. Dunbar's Lieut. 
          having deserted <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">the fort</placeName> (v. Jan. 11 no. 6, encl. :)
          the Sheriff went into it and siezed the robbers he was in quest of, so, "had I 
          had any design on the fort, I might have kept or demolisht it." 
          Begs for a line from his Grace in his justification etc. Continues :
          Notwithstanding Collo. Dunbar's vile representation of me 
          I hear by the late ships from <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName> he is appointed my Lieut. 
          Govr. in <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, this I can scarce believe and would 
          humbly pray of your Grace it may not be so. For how is it 
          possible, My Lord Duke, that the King's service and the good 
          of that Province can be carry'd an end with tolerable quiet, and 
          satisfaction while I must have an officer under me diametrically 
          opposite to me. Let me therefore once more beg it of your 
          Grace as a singular favour, that Collo. Sherburn (whom I formerly 
          mention'd) may be my Lieut. Govr. in New Hampshire etc. 
          Continues : I dissolv'd the Assembly of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">this Province</placeName> the 24th 
          currant after a session of upwards ten weeks, and have issued 
          writs for a new one to be held 26th of next month, in conformity 
          to the Royal Charter, and I now inclose to your Grace the votes 
          of the Assembly from my last to the compleating of this session, 
          by which it will be seen that the Assembly has done nothing in 
          complyance with the King's Instruction either as to fixing a 
          salary on H.M. Govr. or paying the arrearages so justly due to 
          their late Govr.'s children. As to the latter I have no 
          expectation of the Assembly of this Province paying those 
          poor orphans one farthing altho' they had voted the late Govr. 
          Burnett 6000£ a few days before his death, yet now they are 
          not willing to pay what was due to that time being 3400£. As 
          to the fixing a salary etc., I have no reason to think they will 
          ever do anything further or nearer to it than the bill transmitted 
          Dec. 10th past etc. Continues : Yet might I have the royal 
          leave to sign such a bill I should not doubt it's being a good 
          security for the Govr.'s support. I would therefore humbly 
          pray of your Grace that I might have the King's leave to receive 
          my support in that manner, or some other way that the King 
          may think proper. For with great deference to your Grace I 
          believe it will not be thought reasonable that I must go on to 
          support the King's honour in the character of his Govr. at the 
          expence of my own estate. I can assure your Grace that it's 
          not possible to live in any tolerable figure as the King's Govr. 
          with what H.M. has so moderately requir'd of this Province 
          for a salary to his Govr. and was it fixt agreeable to the King's 
          Instruction, no gentn. with the best husbandry could lay up 
          one farthing at the year's end. I am told the House of Repre- 
          sentatives are addressing H.M. to take off the force of several 
          of his royal Instructions to me. I hope your Grace will give 
          no countenance to an attempt of this nature till I am serv'd 
          with a copy of the said Address or Memorial, that I may make 
          a return to your Grace, and say how far the granting what they 
          are desiring might affect the honour and interest of the Crown, 
          and upon receiving your Grace's commands in this matter, I 
          shall with the greatest fidelity to H.M. return my answer to 
          your Grace etc. I am surpriz'd at the assurance of the House 
          of Representatives to be asking favours of the King, while they
          will not pay the least decent or dutifull respect to his orders. 
          But they are daily endeavoring to incroach upon the little 
          power reserv'd to the Crown in the Royal Charter, of which 
          your Grace may be assur'd I will part with none without my 
          royal Master's orders. I think they have too much already 
          unless they us'd it with more good manners to the King, and 
          more to the benefit of their countrey. Signed, J. Belcher.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Committee 
          of Privy Council. In pursuance of Order on Mr. Noden's 
          petition, 14th April, refer to representation of 5th Feb., 1730, and add :
          The inhabitants of the <placeName ref="#bm" role="direct">Bermuda Islands</placeName> are the 
          only people concerned in the whale fishery there, and they 
          have not hitherto made any objection to the paying for licences 
          on this accompt to their Governor. But notwithstanding this, 
          if your Lordships should be of opinion that this Instruction 
          lately given for preventing the Governor from granting licences 
          shou'd still continue in force in Bermuda since the benefit 
          thereof will wholly result to the inhabitants of those islands, 
          it would seem reasonable that they should make the Governour 
          some satisfaction for it, and that he should be instructed to
          recommend in H.M. name to the Assembly of Bermuda, that 
          they do take the proper means for raising and paying an 
          adequate salary to him in lieu thereof not exceeding the annual 
          sum of 100£., because the whale licences have always been 
          computed to him as part of his salary to that value. [C.O. 38, 8. pp. 156-158.]</p>

        <p>Petition of John Yeamans, Agent of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> to the 
          Council of Trade and Plantations. There is a standing 
          instruction, that in the absence of the Capt. General of the 
          <placeName ref="#leeward" role="direct">Leeward Islands</placeName>, the Lt.-General shall have the chief command, 
          and in his absence the Lt. Govr. of <placeName ref="#nevis" role="direct">Nevis</placeName>, and in his absence 
          the President of the Councill there. It may be of ill consequence 
          to oblige the Lt. Governor of the other islands to receive their 
          orders from the Lt. Governor or President in Nevis, not only 
          on account of the inferior rank and value that island holds 
          among the rest, but also because it is situated to the leeward 
          of Antigua and <placeName ref="#ms" role="indirect">Montserrat</placeName>. There has been no person at the 
          head of Nevis for several years resident there bearing H.M. 
          Commission. As the Lt. General is in a few days expected in 
          <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName>, the chief command must devolve on the President 
          of Nevis etc. Antigua is generally esteemed the most considerable
          of the Leeward Islands on account of its produce, and is 
          by reason of its strength, situation and the convenience of its 
          harbours, of much more consequence to the Crown than either 
          of the rest. It lies to windward of all the rest, and in case of 
          any attempt from an enemy, orders may be dispatched and 
          succours from thence landed in a night's time, in any of the 
          other islands, which could not without great difficulty and 
          length of time be dispatched from either of the said islands to 
          Antigua, because the vessels that carry them must ply to 
          windward, and run the risque of being intercepted by an enemy. 
          'Tis owing to these advantages, as memorialist concieves, that 
          the Capt. General is obliged by his Instructions to reside in 
          Antigua nine months in the year ; that it has always been 
          thought necessary to keep the greatest part of H.M. forces 
          there, and that this is the station appointed for the King's 
          ships of warr, unless when the service requires they should be 
          out upon the cruize. It seems where the greatest strength is etc. 
          Prays that the Lt. Governor of Antigua may be appointed to 
          command in chief in the absence of the Capt. and Lt. General 
          etc. Endorsed, Recd. 17th, Read 21st May, 1731. 2 1/3 pp.

          for amending the staple of tobacco etc. Quote views of Mr. Fane, 
          Lt. Gov. Gooch, and the Commissioners of Customs, and 
          the Agent for Virignia. (v. supra.) The most considerable 
          merchants in the tobacco trade concurred with the Lt. Govr. 
          and Agent of Virginia in desiring that the act might be confirmed. 
          Continue :--We are obliged however to take notice to your 
          Majesty, that some time since a law of this kind, which had 
          been in force about three years, was repealed at the desire of 
          the merchts., which in many particulars bore a very near 
          resemblance to the act in question, tho' they now seem to have 
          altered their opinion upon that subject, yet since the 
          Commissrs. of the Customs do apprehend that this act may be 
          prejudicial to your Majesty's revenue at home, we could not 
          advise the immediate confirmation of it. But, considering that 
          this act is calculated to recover the credit of so important a 
          staple as that of tobacco, considering it contains many clauses 
          well intended for the prevention of frauds, and that your 
          Majesty's quit-rents and the duty of 2s. upon every hogshead 
          of tobacco in Virginia may be thereby improved, because the 
          same will for the future be paid in better tobacco than formerly ; 
          we are humbly of opinion that your Majesty may be pleased 
          to suffer this act to lye by probationary, until the effects of it 
          may be seen. This being a temporary law, will of itself expire 
          in four years, but, by the method we humbly propose, it will be 
          always in your Majesty's power to repeal the same within that 
          term, if it shall be found prejudicial to your Majesty's revenue, 
          or to the trade of your subjects. [C.O. 5, 1366. pp. 61-71.]</p>

          Order of Committee of Privy Council. Referring enclosed memorial
          to the Council of Trade and Plantations for their report.
          Signed, W. Cary. Endorsed, Recd. 21st May, Read 8th June, 1731. 3/4 p. Enclosed, 
          188. i. Petition of Thomas Beake, Agent for <placeName ref="#stchristophers" role="direct">St. Christophers</placeName>, 
          to the King in Council. The Legislature of said island 
          finding that the fees in the Court of Chancery were 
          very grievous, and that some of them had a law for 
          their sanction and that in other the Secretary had 
          bound himself by no rule but his own will, and that in 
          several other branches of his office, and particularly 
          in the Ordinaries he had raised his own fees and the 
          Governor's to near the double of what they are settled 
          at by law, and Wavell Smith the Secretary having 
          of late set no bounds to his fees, occasioned a generall 
          dissatisfaction and outcry among the people, and some 
          instances of it happening to appear in proof before the 
          Assembly, when the Chief Justice and Mr. Smith were 
          heard at the barr of their house upon a contest between 
          them, and the Assembly being then upon a bill for 
          regulating fees they thought it proper to enquire into 
          the Secretary's fees and to redress any grievance that 
          might arise therefrom. To this end on 19th Dec. 
          1729 the Assembly appointed a Committee to enquire 
          what fees were then taken by the Officers attending 
          the Courts of Justice etc., with power to send for 
          persons, papers and records. Mr. Smith allarmed at 
          such an order and well knowing his actions would not 
          bear examination, when the Committee summoned 
          him and his deputy to attend with an account of such 
          fees, himself refused to attend, and sent his Deputy 
          with an account only of what fees he took in the Courts 
          of King's Bench and Common Pleas, and of no other 
          fees in his other offices etc. On 30th Dec. therefore 
          it was resolved by the House that he was guilty of an 
          act of disobedience to its authority, but deferred 
          passing any censure upon him, to see whether he would 
          make any excuse and produce his docquett of fees and 
          offer himself to be examined thereupon etc. But in 
          defiance and contempt of the House, he went off to 
          <placeName ref="#ag" role="indirect">Antigua</placeName>, whereby it was evident he refused to comply 
          with the orders of the House etc. Whereupon the 
          House addressed the Governor to suspend him from 
          the Council until H.M. pleasure should be known,           
          (21st April). The Council on the same day resolved 
          that his refusing to attend the Committee in order to 
          his being examined was a great contempt and indignity 
          offered to that House, and that such his refusall was 
          a presumptious offence. They also advised the 
          Commander in Chief to send a copy of the Assembly's 
          address and their resolve to Mr. Smith requiring him 
          to send immediately a satisfactory answer, in default 
          whereof they then advised his Honour to suspend him 
          from his office as Councillor. Mr. Smith sent (19th 
          May) an answer upon which the House resolved that 
          it was untrue and evasive and reflecting on the honour 
          and justice of the House and in a conference with the 
          Council resolved to request his Honour to suspend 
          Mr. Smith. Prays that H.M. will remove him from the Council etc.

          from the bond into which the Assembly compelled him to enter

          The money never came into his hands, but 
          was applied solely to the public service with the 
          consent and advice of the Council. Petitioner with 
          great assiduity repaired the forts etc. He was obliged 
          to build two large sloops to fetch provisions for the 
          garrison, which being cast away, he lost upwards of 
          800£. Prays for an allowance for his expences and losses etc.

          of Trade above 16 years, 9 as Secretary etc. And 
          forasmuch as Petitioner and his clerks have no other 
          advantage from their places than their salarys, (so

          and Government, and a readiness to comply with all H.M, 
          Instructions to the utmost of their power, which I trust will be 
          very evident to your Grace when you shall see the Journal of 
          the Assembly. I am preparing a large map of this province 
          for H.M. view, drawn from several observations I collected 
          when I was Surveyor Genll, of this Province and many helps 
          I have received from several gentlemen of this and the neigh-

          this opportunity on our first meeting after the publication
          of your Majesty's purchase of the sovereignty 
          of this Province ; to acknowledge with the profoundest 
          gratitude the many blessings we enjoy under your 
          auspicious and happy reign. It is with the greatest 
          pleasure we observe your Majesty and our gracious 
          Queen Caroline always intent on promoting the 
          happiness of all your people ; and altho' we are so 
          remote from your Royal presence, we find ourselves 
          nevertheless assured of your fatherly care and concern.
          We are in duty bound to acknowledge as a 
          particular mark of your indulgence, the placing 
          over us H. E. George Burrington Esq. etc., who by 
          his behaviour during the time he governed this 
          Province for the Lords Proprietors rendred himself 
          very agreable to the people by the great care he then 
          shewed in his due administration of Justice, and in 
          promoting the wellfare of this Province ; on which 
          occasion his indefatigable industry and the hardships 
          he underwent in carrying on the settlement at  
          <placeName ref="#us_nc_capefear" role="direct">Cape Fear</placeName> deserves our thankful remembrance.
          The Governor having laid before us several of your 
          Majesty's Instructions relating to this Province, we 
          think it our duty thankfully to acknowledge your 
          Majesty's great clemency and goodness expressed in 
          those Instructions toward the people of this your 
          Province ; and as some of them do necessarily require 
          that your Majesty should be informed of the state 
          and condition of this country, we have directed a 
          Committee to transmit a true state thereof. Pray for 
          H.M. long reign and the succession of the House of Hanover.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Lt. Governor 
          Gooch. Acknowledges letters etc. of 29th June and 7th Sept., 
          1729, 9th Jan., 9th April, 29th May, 23rd July and 14th 
          Sept., 1730, and 12th and 27th Feb., 1731. Continue: 
          We commend your punctuality in corresponding with us, 
          and we should not have been wanting in proper returns to 
          you, but the subject matter of most of the above-mentioned 
          letters related principally to your scheme for improving the 
          staple of tobacco, and the law which you pass'd in consequence 
          of it, which being matters of very great consequence, required 
          a very mature consideration, and it is but very lately that we 
          have been able to come to any determination concerning them, 
          wherefore we chose to defer writing to you, till we could give 
          you some account of them in our letter. Upon considering 
          this law, we thought it for H.M. service, and for the service of 
          all those who are concern'd in the trade to <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName>,
          to receive the different opinions of such persons as might give us any 
          further light into this matter ; and as we have met with some 
          who were very sanguine for the confirmation of this act, and 
          some as sanguine for the repeal of it, we have chose the midway,
          and have offer'd our opinion to H.M. that the same may lye 
          by probationary, in order to try the good effects you expect 
          may result from it ; As the pressing instances you have made, 
          and the many reasons you have offer'd to us in behalf of this 
          act, have greatly weigh'd with us in our resolution concerning 
          the same, we think it the more incumbent upon you, supposing 
          H.M. should be graciously pleased to confirm our report, to 
          have a watchfull eye over the persons who are to put this act 
          in execution, that no partiality be shewn to any person, and 
          thereby bad tobacco exported from your Colony ; For we 
          must upon this occasion remind you, that an act of this nature 
          was pass'd in 1713, and after some years experience was repealed 
          in 1717, at the desire of all the Virginia merchts., who did 
          assure the then Board of Trade, that the Agents, who by that 
          act were the same officers, and had the same duty as those who 
          by this are called inspectors, did permit as much trash tobacco, 
          to be exported as before the passing that act. This was one of 
          the reasons why we did not propose your law to be confirm'd, 
          and because we shall now have it in our power to advise the 
          King to repeal the same, as we certainly shall do, if we find by 
          experience that this act does not answer the intent of its passing, 
          better than the other law did, in which case the Colony 
          of Virginia will have been put to a very great expence to no 
          purpose ; we must therefore repeat once more, that it is the 
          more incumbent upon you to take great care of the execution 
          of this law, since you have been so very pressing for its 
          confirmation. We have recommended Col. Harrison to be of 
          the Council etc., and he has been appointed accordingly. It 
          was not possible for us to comply with your request in favour 
          of Mr. Armistead, having been for some time before engag'd 
          to recommend Col. Bray, as we have now done in the room of 
          Mr. Page. We are glad to find that you have at last brought 
          the negroes to a quiet submission, and we hope that by your 
          prudent management they may be kept so for the future. 
          Your letter of 14th Dec. last, wherein, you say, you gave us 
          an account of the insurrection of the negroes, never came to 
          our hands. [C.O. 5, 1366. pp. 71-74.]</p>

          of the Court of Chancery in Antigua, and for supplying some 
          defects in a former act referr'd to in the title. But the main 
          purport of the act, is to enable the Lieut. General in the absence 
          of your Majesty's Capt. General, the Lieut. Govr. of Antigua, 
          in their absence, and the President of the Council, in the absence 
          of the other three Officers aforesaid, to preside in and hold 
          Courts of Chancery there, for the hearing of causes and the 
          dispatch of such business as shall be depending in the said 
          Court. We have taken the opinion of Mr. Fane, one of your 
          Majesty's Counsel learned in the law, and he conceives the 
          several provisions therein contained, not to be lyable to 
          any objection in point of law, save in one particular only, 
          where it is attempted to exclude all Courts held in any other 
          country except in the island of Antigua, from making decrees 
          or orders in case of suit for lands, tenements or hereditaments, 
          where the interest or thing sued for, shall lye in that island, 
          and in case of personal demands where the person or persons 
          of the defendant or defendants are or shall be resident in the 
          said island, for tho' he is of opinion that this clause will not 
          be sufficient to restrain the jurisdiction of any of the Courts 
          in <placeName ref="#gb" role="secondary">Great Britain</placeName>, yet he thinks, it seems to be particularly 
          calculated against the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery 
          here, which is an attempt which ought to be discountenanced. 
          We have likewise been attended by several merchants and 
          planters, who are desirous that this act should receive your 
          Majesty's royal approbation. The principal reason offered 
          in support of this act, and contained in the preamble, are, that 
          the inhabitants labour under great delays and inconveniences 
          in the prosecuting of their rights in Chancery, by reason of the 
          Chief Governor's frequent and long absence from Antigua, and 
          from a power exercised by the said Govrs. of granting and 
          dissolving of injunctions in causes depending in Antigua, whilst 
          they are resident in some other of the <placeName ref="#leeward" role="indirect">Leeward Islands</placeName>;
          and we are of opinion that proper remedies should be provided 
          against these evils. We have no objection therefore to such 
          parts of this act as relate simply to the regulation of proceedings 
          in the Court of Chancery ; but we cannot approve that part 
          of it, whereby the Lieut. General, in the absence of your 
          Majesty's Capt. General, or the Lt. Govr. etc. in their absence 
          are enabled to preside in and hold Courts of Chancery, because 
          we do apprehend that the appointment of Judges and 
          Chancellors, being a very material part of the royal prerogative, 
          ought always to be exercised immediately by your Majesty, 
          or, by some persons to whom your Majesty shall especially 
          delegate that power, and not by a clause in an act of Assembly, 
          and the rather, because your Majesty may from time to time 
          make such alterations or additions to your Royal orders and 
          appointments as may be suitable to the occasions and advantage 
          of your subjects, but an act of Assembly cannot be repealed, 
          whatever inconveniences may ensue from it, without the consent 
          of the people. The most proper method, therefore, in our 
          humble opinion, of attaining what is proposed by this act, 
          most suitable to your Majesty's royal prerogative, and equally 
          safe and expedient for the people of Antigua, would be, that 
          your Majesty should be pleased especially to appoint some 
          person in Antigua to preside as Chancellor, and execute all the 
          functions of that Office, in the absence of your Majesty's Capt. 
          General or Commander in Chief, by which means the course 
          of Justice would be continued without interruption, and the 
          complaint, which has been so much insisted upon, of granting 
          and revoking injunctions by the Governor General, when absent 
          from Antigua, might likewise be entirely removed. The only 
          objection to the doing of this now, arises from some words in 
          the first Chancery act already refer'd to, whereby it is presumed 
          your Majesty cannot, in any case or on any emergency, appoint 
          another person to preside in the said Court, during the residence 
          of the Commander in Chief in any other of the Leeward Islands, 
          because it is by that law enacted, that from henceforth all and 
          every Court and Courts of Chancery which shall be holden for 
          this island of Antigua, shall consist of and be holden by the 
          Capt. General or Governor in Chief etc., and five or more of the 
          Council of this island at least. But if this be a real difficulty 
          it is at least a difficulty which the Assembly of Antigua may 
          easily remove by a new law, whereby your Majesty may be 
          impowered, notwithstanding the aforesaid Chancery act, or 
          anything therein contained from time to time to nominate 
          such person or persons as your Majesty shall think most proper 
          to supply the duty of the Commander in Chief, and preside, 
          during his absence, in the Court of Chancery in Antigua, may 
          do ; But upon this occasion, we cannot help observing, that 
          great caution ought to be had in making concessions of this 
          sort to any Colony, when an uncommon favour already granted, 
          is made use of, as an argument to obtain another still more 
          extraordinary. The people of Antigua are already upon a 
          different footing from the rest of the Leeward Islands, by virtue 
          of the law which this act is intended to amend : For in Antigua 
          only the Councillors have the right of sitting and voting in the 
          Court of Chancery with your Majesty's Governor ; But if this 
          new act should pass, the Council with their President, may 
          some times have opportunities of deciding causes without the 
          assistance of the Capt. Genl., Lieut. Genl., or Lieut. Governor, 
          whose presence may reasonably be assumed to be some 
          check upon their proceedings, which might possibly be 
          subject to strong influences, from consanguinity at least, in 
          an island where all the principal inhabitants, by frequent 
          intermarriages, are nearly related. For all which reasons, we 
          humbly propose that your Majesty should be pleased to signify 
          your disallowance of this act. [C.O. 153, 15. pp. 98-105.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. Representation upon Act of 
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="direct">New York</placeName>, 1730, to prevent the taking 
          or levying on specialities more than the principal, interest and 
          cost of suit, and other purposes therein mentioned etc. Continue : 
          Mr. Fane has made several objections to the confirmation 
          of it, which are both of a legal and prudential nature. The Act 
          appears to have taken its rise from some late executions had 
          upon judgments obtained in the Province of New York, whereby 
          the whole penalties of the bonds have been levied instead of 
          the sums really due, and to prevent this practice for the future, 
          this law provides that if, upon any judgment obtained, or upon 
          actions brought and agreed before judgment, any plaintiff or 
          his attorney shall take or levy more than the principal debt, 
          lawful interest and costs of suit, the person or persons so 
          offending shall forfeit double damages to the party grieved, 
          with treble costs of suit, to be recovered in any Court of Record 
          in the province of New York. To this provision, it is objected 
          that according to the practice of the Law Courts in <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName>, 
          plaintiffs do always recover the whole penalties of their bonds, 
          but should they levy more than the real debt, with cost and 
          charges, the party grieved has a remedy by a bill in equity, in 
          which case the plaintiff shall refund with costs, and the people 
          of New York have not only the same opportunity of redressing 
          themselves in a Court of Equity, but likewise an easier way of 
          obtaining Justice, because their common law courts will, upon 
          motion, examine in a summary way into any wrong of that 
          sort, which is what the common law courts in England cannot 
          do, whereby the injured party is obliged to sue for relief in a 
          Court of Equity. It is likewise apprehended that this Act 
          will tend to multiply litigious suits at law, by encouraging the 
          debtor not to oppose or remonstrate against an unwarrantable 
          levy in execution of judgment, or what is still worse, by tempting 
          him to agree in appearance to any exorbitant demand of the 
          plaintiff, and accordingly to pay more than was really due to 
          him, with no other prospect than that of recovering double 
          damages and treble costs of suit, in which case, his gain upon 
          recovery would be proportionable to the money he had 
          knowingly paid in his own wrong. We therefore humbly 
          propose that your Majesty should be pleased to signify your 
          disallowance of it etc. [C.O. 5, 1125. pp. 162-164.]</p>

          Lt. Governor Gordon to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. On the 29th ult. I had the honour to receive 
          your Lordships' commands of 8th Sept. delivered to me by 
          Mr. Browne etc. I am so conscious, my Lords, of having done 
          nothing with relation to Mr. Brown but what is just and well 
          to be defended, that I may venture to assure your Lordships 
          his complaint shall receive a proper answer. I have given him 
          regular notice to attend the examinations on my side etc. with 
          leave to cross-examine ; and he hath already heard such 
          depositions as must make him ashamed to have troubled your 
          Lordships with an affair so frivolous with respect to me, and so 
          exceedingly dishonourable to himself etc. Continues : In 
          answer to a paragraph in your Lordships' said orders etc., when 
          I received a deputation from the Proprietors etc., I had their 
          instructions to correspond frequently with them, and to acquaint 
          them with the state of their Province, which I have punctually 
          done etc. ; I likewise knew it was my duty to acquaint H.M. 
          Ministers and particularly your Right Honourable Board, in 
          case anything of moment which might be for H.M. service 
          should occurr, and to acknowledge and pay due obedience to 
          those directions I should receive from them, which last I have 
          never neglected to doe. But in <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="direct">this inland Province</placeName>
          so few things happen of any consequence to H.M. interest, and scarce 
          any at all have happened since my arrival here, that I judged 
          it improper to take up your Lordships' time with matters of 
          so small importance. Signed, P. Gordon. Endorsed, Recd.
