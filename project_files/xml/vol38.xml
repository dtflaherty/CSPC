        Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Since I 
        had the honour of writing you last I have met the Assembly 
        of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">this Province</placeName> and after recommending to them what I thought 
        needfull for H.M. honour and service, and their own good, and 
        in a more especial manner pressing upon them H.M. 27th 
        Instruction for fixing a salary on me and my successor I waited 
        on them in a session of eighteen dayes, and finding they wou'd         
        come to no amendments on the bill they had past before, I 
        dissolv'd them, and inclose your Grace a Journal of the pro- 
        ceedings at this short session. I have issu'd writts for a new 
        Assembly to meet the 10th of next mo. and hope there will be a 
        change in the Assembly for the better advancing H.M. honour 
        and service, and nothing in my power shall be wanting towards 
        it. But should it be otherwise I think I have done but my 
        duty in dissolving the late Assembly since they would come 
        no nearer to the King's Instruction, etc. Repeats recommendation 
        of Mr. Sherburn for Lt. Gov. of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="descriptive">N.H.</placeName> v. Dec. 15, 1730. On 
        24th Dec. received Additional Instruction of Sept. 26th for the 
        better preservation of H.M. woods and issued Proclamations 
        in both Provinces accordingly. Continues : This day I receiv'd 
        from Col. Dunbar H.M. Order in Council, 12th Nov., mentioning 
        a representation that I was preparing a military expedition 
        against <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's fort</placeName> etc. Continues : In this representation 
        my Lord Duke there is not the shadow of truth, nor did I ever 
        make the least attempt or preparation of that nature. Yet I 
        am not at all surpriz'd that Col. Dunbar had the folly, and 
        confidence as well as malice to make such a representation 
        against me. Because I am lately told he has wrote many other 
        palpable falshoods to do me all the hurt in his power, but if he 
        would confine himself to truth I should not give myself any 
        trouble about him : the ship by which this goes sails in the 
        morning, that I shall not be able to send your Grace the necessary 
        papers of a notorious riott committed by some people belonging 
        to Frederick's fort on some of H.M. subjects of this Province, 
        as also what I directed H.M. Lt. Govr. of this Province to 
        do at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> upon a visitation I order'd him to make to all 
        the fortifications of this Province. Another ship will sail in a 
        few dayes by which I shall send these things for my justification, 
        and which I believe will be to the intire satisfaction of H.M. 
        and his Ministers, and convince your Grace with what injustice 
        this gentleman has treated me. If he intends to take upon 
        him the office of an informer upon all my actions, and then to 
        present them in a false light, it will be giving your Grace and the 
        rest of H.M. Ministers a vast deal of unnecessary trouble. I 
        should be glad when he seeks to make any complaints against 
        me for the future that he would serve me with a copy before 
        he sends them away, then my answer might go in the same 
        ship, and had he done so now, I presume there had been no 
        occasion for H.M. order to me of 12th Nov., the matter on which 
        it is founded being absolutely false. I ask pardon for giving 
        your Grace so great an interruption from the vast affairs of 
        Europe, that ingross your precious hours etc. Signed, J. Belcher.

        <p>Copy of proceedings of the General Court of the 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, Sept., Oct., 1730, relating to a 
          riot at <placeName ref="us_me_newharbor" role="direct">New Harbour</placeName>, near Pemaquid, in York County,
          upon the complaint of Josiah Grover against some 
          Irish settlers, who seized him and his fishing schooner 
          and company when he went to clear and settle some 
          land there purchased by his ancestor, John Brown, 
          from the Indians 15th July, 1625. He escaped to 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName> and complains to the Governor, who instructed 
          the Justices of <placeName ref="#us_me_york" role="descriptive">York Town</placeName> to enquire into the matter. 
          Four Irishmen were apprehended at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> by the 
          Sheriff and committed for trial at the next General 
          Sessions. They acknowledged that they assisted in 
          seizing Grover's schooner, and said that they had orders 
          to do so from Alexander Hamilton, Captain of the 
          Fort. When the Sheriff came near Pemaquid, he 
          saw the colours flying at the fort, and being informed 
          by some Irish people that they designed to resist him, 
          he sent a message to the officer there that he came 
          with authority to apprehend some criminals etc. and 
          required his assistance, who answered that he would 
          keep his fort and did not admit the Sheriff etc. The 
          guns were loaded, but the messenger warned the officer 
          that if he went on, they would every one be hanged. 
          Upon which Hamilton said he would take advice with 
          his Council, and went out of the fort, and the Sheriff 
          entered without opposition etc. Copy. 11 pp. </p>

          Col. Dunbar to Mr. Popple. Refers to former letters. 
          Continues : As to my disputes with the New Engld. people 
          I hope I shall be justifyed ; if ever any body was among them 
          without disputes, I will own myself in the fault and submit to 
          be sacrificed to their resentment ; since their Committee was 
          at <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Fredericksfort</placeName> I have been threatened with many actions 
          of trespass, and even high treason for building a fort and hoisting 
          the King's colours, wch. they themselves prostitute at their 
          little pallisadoed truck houses to exchange rum, molasses, and 
          tobacco etc. with the Indians ; I landed here the 10th instant 
          haveing been 12 days in my passage from Fredericksfort ; I 
          was in great danger by islands of ice in the <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="direct">river of Kennebeck</placeName>, 
          but I was obliged to go into that river to stop some saw mills 
          there who were destroying a fine swamp of pine trees near ye 
          water upon lands wch. I have reserved for the Royal Navy in 
          case the Proprietors or claimts. are disallow'd by H.M. etc. I 
          could not avoyd makeing some appointments of lands within 
          10 miles of the fort, where people are clearing ye woods, and 
          converting the timber, wch. is oak, birch, ash, maple and 
          popple, to ship timber, cord wood, and for pottash, and in order 
          to plant corn, garden seeds, hemp and flax in the spring, if I 
          had not done so, of course all would have dispersed, and would 
          never be induced to return, so that <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> would boast 
          of a victory, than which nothing could be a greater mortification 
          to me ; I have not presumed to make any grant, or exercise 
          any sort of jurisdiction, tho' many applications have been 
          frequently made to me in small cases, as a Governour or 
          Majestrate ; I dare not have refused hearing ye partys, then 
          gave my opinion, complaining it was hard upon me, haveing 
          no assistce. to be troubled with little disputes, and desired they 
          might either defer matters or agree among themselves until 
          majestrates could be appointed, and thus I have satisfied the 
          people, and kept them together, but if after all, they must quit 
          and loose their labour, many familys will be undone, and I 
          the unhappy occasion of their misery, as I am at this time of 
          my own ruine and my familys by my zeal and perseverance to 
          promote this settlement, because I am convinced beyond all 
          doubt that it will be very considerable and satisfactory to H.M. ; 
          I send to my Lords Commissioners a smal parcel of hemp and 
          flax, the produce of new ground at Fredericksfort of this year 
          and from New England seed, the seed wch. I had from <placeName ref="#pl_danzig" role="indirect">Dantzick</placeName> 
          by way of <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName>, being treacherously kept concealed until 
          the season was over ; I wish I had a fund to send for some of 
          each this year, and for two or more potash makers to <placeName ref="#pl" role="indirect">Poland</placeName> 
          or <placeName ref="#ru" role="indirect">Russia</placeName>.
          I think I could promise to serve <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> with 
          those commoditys in return for their manufacturys without 
          bringing away any of their mony, it is seldome any poor man's 
          scheme is worth anything, however hints may be usefull to 
          great ones ; I ought to be sufficiently discouraged as no notice 
          is ever taken from any of the Offices of my letters, yet I live in 
          hopes, wch. onely supports my spirits. These small samples 
          of hemp and flax, are not in such perfection as they would be 
          had I been at the place in time ; ye person I chiefly depended 
          upon to pull and dress them went away being discouraged by 
          common reports, an Irishwoman pulled, water-rotted and 
          dressed the flax, and the hemp was in the grownd when I arrived 
          there in the end of October, so that it was dew-rotted and even 
          frozen as it stood, the man who dressed it as you see it, has 
          made ropes and geer for cattle and carriages of some of it, and 
          assures me it is very strong, and undertakes to make it of as 
          fine a colour as flax next year, he tells me ye hemp here will 
          be finer than any European and has a good deal of the soft 
          nature of flax etc. From Kennebeck I went to <placeName ref="#us_me_portland" role="direct">Casco</placeName>, where 
          there is onely one loading of masts provideing this year, the 
          rest being contracted for at <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="direct">Piscatua</placeName>, wch. I am glad of in 
          respect to the Province of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> who are generally 
          a loyal good sort of people ; I went to ye undertakers house for 
          ye contract, and shewed him the orders I reed, to prevent 
          logging, he insisted on his right not to be interrupted, and 
          alleddged that he logged on his own private property etc. Refers 
          to enclosed letters which passed between them. Continues : Near 
          his house wch. is built in the woods and upon grownd cleared 
          within three years past, are five new mills each saw can cut 5 
          and sometimes 6000 feet of pine boards in 24 hours, he told me 
          if I sho'd stop his mills it would be ten pounds pr. diem damage ; 
          the lands about Casco are generally called private property, 
          and not one owner of a mill there but was pleased with the easy 
          proposal I made them to prove their property. I hope I am 
          not blameable for this condescention, and besides I am of 
          opinion yt. few or none of them will be deemed good ; some 
          shewed me their titles wch. were patents passed by Sir Edmd. 
          Andros in 1688, wherein are reserves of wheat and mony to 
          the Crown as an annual quit-rent, when I took notice of those 
          reservations, and sayd I would acquaint H.M. therewith, they 
          then disdained those titles, and sayd they did not esteem them, 
          for that they had some old titles from Sir Ferdinando Gorge 
          and Indian deeds ; I asked why they would produce Sir Edmond 
          Andros's pats, to me, they replyed because they seemed best to 
          the eye, but that it was an imposition of his to extort mony 
          from the people. Upon enquiry I find there are very many of 
          those patents, and all register'd, and if no quit-rent has been 
          received since, wch. is payable to H.M. or His Capt. Genll, of 
          the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Masachusets</placeName>, it will amount to a considerable sum, and 
          may easily be recovered after a reform in this Governmt., wch. 
          I hope is now upon the anvil. What I am now speaking of is 
          in the large county of York, formerly called the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">Province of Maine</placeName>,
          90 miles along the sea coast and backwards to ye <placeName ref="#pacific" role="boundary">South Sea</placeName>
          in the original grant ; My Lords Commrs. may think 
          that country is settled and peopled, whereas 20 miles in length 
          and halfe so much in width would be sufficient for them ; there 
          is yet onely one line of towns layd out there and they extend 
          all along the shore and onely eight miles backwards into the 
          country, thus many many millions of acres lye wast, whilst 
          these gentry are opposeing H.M. to make other parts usefull 
          to the Crowne ; if such matters are not represented home, no 
          remedy can ever be applyed ; this country not content with all 
          this ; do claim most part of <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>; it is this stragling 
          manner of settlement has (with their natural ill treatment of 
          all persons) allways exposed them to the insults of the Indians, 
          which (besides many poor souls cutt off), has cost them a great 
          many thousand pounds, and all might have been prevented by 
          gentle usage and some small present yearly to the poor natives, 
          who, unprovoked, seem a good natured people ; I herewith 
          send you a complaint from a Jesuit at one of their tribes 
          settlemt., to whom I wrote in English hearing he was an Irish 
          or Scotchman ; I hope by his influence to secure the friendship 
          of his tribe. Acknowledges receipt of H.M. Additional 
          Instruction for giving his share of the penalties upon loggers 
          to informers. Will endeavour to prevent any abuse of that 
          indulgence etc. Continues : I likewise received (Sunday, 10th 
          Jan.) an office pacquet for Governour Belcher, with which I 
          went to wait upon him, and he being ingaged at dutys (as they 
          call them) I sent it by a gentleman on Monday morning, and 
          wrote to him that some reasons to which he was no stranger 
          prevented my waiting upon him, one of wch. was, the threats 
          of the mobb etc. Encloses his answer, (encl. i). Continues : 
          It is wonderfull how this great man and generally his country- 
          men can act and say, and deny both. His behaviour and useage 
          of me is beyond my imagination, and tho' to my face he denyed 
          many things, I could prove them by many wittnesses, his last 
          stroke is most provokeing of all, he has given out here that I 
          was a spy in <placeName ref ="#es" role="indirect">Spain</placeName> and was so here now upon him and the 
          country. I hope as he is not comeatable here my Lords will 
          think I ought to have some satisfaction for so gross an abuse, 
          one consequence of it had likely to have fallen lately upon 
          Capt. Protheroe, Commander of ye Station ship, who walking 
          in ye street, a man enquired of another who he was, answer 
          was made, Collo. Dunbar, whereupon one replyed God d n 
          him lett us mobb him, but being undeceived, the Capt. escaped ; 
          I came onely hither to attend the Courts upon account of the 
          expences I was unawares drawn into last year at Fredericks-fort,
          and here mett the additional trouble of the return of 500/. 
          sterl. bills drawn by me on my groweing sallary wch. are pro- 
          tested. I intend in a few days to New Hampshire and into the 
          woods, and to send one of my Deputys to remain at Casco. 
          You no doubt have all the proceedings of this Great and General 
          Court transmitted by his Excy. to my Lords, no Governour 
          was ever more hated than he, and notwithstanding any assure- 
          ances he may give to the Ministry of succeeding in getting a 
          fixed sallary from the new Assembly, everybody tells me it 
          never will be given to him, and his pretences are onely to spin 
          out time, and keep the affair out of Parliament. I am even 
          told that the country have soe great an abhorrence of him for 
          betraying them (as they call it) that many of the first rank 
          are upon an Address to H.M. to give them any other Governr. 
          and they will comply with the Instructn. His chief Councilour 
          and favourite is the famous incendiary Dr. Cook, whose character 
          is known at home, and both the Govr. and Doctor irreconcileable 
          enemys to ye Dudley family who are reputed ye chiefs 
          of this country ; they were allways for the sallary and the 
          favourite Cook ever against it, wch. seems unaccountable that 
          a Governour is in earnest, and caresses the man, who is at 
          the head of his opposers. My Lords have heard of Govr. 
          Wentworth's death of New Hampshire, he was a worthy honest 
          gentleman, and is much lamented by the country, it is worth 
          nothing to be Leiut. Governour, who has no sallary but 200£. 
          this country mony, which all chief Governours before Mr. 
          Belcher gave out of their 200£. sterl., and he would not give a 
          shilling, nor is that small province able to give any ; they are 
          apprehensive that Mr. Belcher has recommended one Mr. 
          Waldron to be Lt. Govr., who was Clerk to the Council, 
          and is so now and yet is made a Councillour and a Judge by Mr. 
          Belcher, who has made great changes there, heavy upon gentle- 
          men who were putt in by Mr. Shute and Mr. Burnet for their 
          dutyfull and cheerfull complyance wth. ye Royal instructions. 
          Mr. George Jaffrey is one of them, he is of the Council, was one 
          of the Judges, and Treasurer of the Province, and Vice- judge 
          of the Admiralty, he is a man of good sense, fortune and figure, 
          and much the fittest to command that Province, I believe he 
          would accept of it, tho' I really do not know, but this I am sure 
          that no man there is more disaggreable to the King's friends than 
          Mr. Waldron. I was exceedingly surprised upon my arrival 
          here two days agoe to hear that Govr. Belcher had closetted 
          Mr. Auchmuty the Advocate General and prevailed upon him 
          to give a strange turn and construction to the conference he was 
          wittness to, wch. I gave my Lords an account of by my brother. 
          I taxed the Advocate Genll, with it who swore to me it was 
          false, and that he omitted nothing but the Governour's telling 
          me of sending down 500 men to dismantle the fort and take 
          the people prisoners, he promised to send me a copy of what 
          he gave Mr. Belcher, and to add that circumstance to it, wch. 
          he sayd had escaped his memory, but I rather take it he did it 
          out of complemt. to His Excellency. Mr. Auchmuty has told 
          ye story as I related it to my Lords Commrs., in twenty 
          places in this town etc. Continues : I am informed that many 
          heads here are now at work plodding against me. I defye all 
          the world whilst they stick to truth, but they would do anything 
          to have me removed etc. I am this moment told that there is 
          a Council sitting upon the report of the tryal of the four poor 
          men, brought from near Fredericksfort by order of this General 
          Court fr. the High Sheriffe of the county of York in October 
          last, it is sayd they are convicted but I am not able to learn for 
          what crime etc. I told you formerly they had onely stoped a 
          sloop from taking away some staves cutt by themselves. The 
          Governour wanted to try them for piracy. Pray Sir, Lay this 
          before my Lords etc. Signed, David Dunbar. Endorsed, Recd.

        Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and Plantations. Repeats gists of
        covering letter, Jan. 11th, and refers to those enclosures. Adds : These things, my Lords, 
        are the whole of what I have ever done respecting <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's 
        Fort</placeName> etc., and how was it possible for me to do less ? I inclose 
        your Lordships a memorial I deliver'd into H.M. Secretary of 
        State the 15th May last, in answer to which I should have been 
        very glad of some orders or directions for my conduct, but never 
        receiv'd a word of answer till his Majesty's order in Council of 
        12th Novr. last. According to the clause of the Charter cited 
        in my memorial these lands My Lords are doubtless a part of 
        this Province, and agreeable thereto your Lordships will find 
        in H.M. Commission to me these words, " And <placeName ref="#us_me_sagadahock" role="direct">the lands</placeName> lying 
        between the said territory of <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="indirect">Nova Scotia</placeName>, 
        and the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="indirect">Province of Main</placeName>." 
        Quotes Commission to show that it makes the Charter 
        " the great rule of my Government " etc. Continues : How 
        dare I then disobey H.M. or betray the trust he has repos'd 
        in me by refusing a legal protection to his good subjects, when 
        they apply to me. These rioters, My Lords, have been since 
        legally convicted in H.M. Courts, and must doubtless undergo 
        the penalties of the law for such a breach of H.M. peace, and so 
        notorious an assault and riott committed upon the property, 
        and liberty of H.M. good subjects. I am here, my Lords, H.M. 
        Govr. to see a good execution of all his wholsome laws for 
        the safety of his subjects under my care in their lives and 
        estates, and to this end I will endeavour carefully to use the 
        power the King has delegated to me in his Royal Commission 
        etc. Continues : It is false in Col. Dunbar to say, No private 
        persons have hitherto set up any claim on those lands, because 
        there have been a great many claims made, and are made daily, 
        and the people that claim think they have a just right (tho' 
        not by any grant of this Province) and one of the men whom 
        Coll. Dunbar's people riotted and assaulted has a claim there 
        descended down to him for 105 years past as may be seen in 
        his complaint against these notorious riotters. My Lords, 
        every man's private property is his life, and I can't answer for 
        people's giving away what they think their own. But for the 
        right of this government to those lands according to the Royal 
        Charter. Had Coll. Dunbar wisely manag'd about 'em I think 
        I should have had influence enough with this Assembly to have 
        made a cession of their right to the Crown : and it was always 
        my opinion that it wou'd be greatly to the advantage of this 
        Province, that the Crown should settle those lands. Yet etc. 
        I know not how to answer those that say, The Crown has always 
        supposed these lands to be a part of this Province, or why have 
        the Govrs. of the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="indirect">Massachussetts</placeName> been ordered from time 
        to time to insist with the Assemblies to rebuild the Fort at 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName>. They say why have not the Governours of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">New 
        Hampshire</placeName> and Nova Scotia had those Instructions, and again 
        the King has directed the choice of a Councellour in the Royal 
        Charter to be chosen on account of those lands, and who of 
        course becomes one of the Legislators of H.M. Province of the 
        Massachusetts Bay, and without such a Councellour the present 
        Constitution cannot subsist. My Lords, I should be glad, I 
        say, to be instructed how to answer these things etc. Concludes : 
        I am tired of writing as I fear your Lordships will be of 
        reading, yet I must not be so vilely traduc'd and not answer 
        for myself ; I am an honest man, and hope ever to appear so. 
        Nor cou'd I possibly have done more from my arrival to this 
        day, than I have, in support of H.M. Dominions as well as for the 
        welfare of the Provinces under my care etc. Signed, J. Belcher.

        Proposes the construction of roads, every inhabitant 
        supplying his every sixth negro for that purpose etc. 
        The rebel negroes would then have to surrender, and, 
        amounting to 10,000 could be sold at 201. a head to 
        pay expences and for maintaining forts etc. The 
        mountainous woods at present occupied by the negroes 
        or unoccupied would then supply abundance of game 
        and provisions. Also it is well known there have been 
        veins of gold and silver ore found in the blew moun- 
        tains, which the dread of the negroes alone prevents 
        being explored etc. 2| large pp. [C.O 137, 53. ff.

        <p>Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Refers 
          to letter of 11th Jan. Continues : My worthy friend and 
          agent Mr. John Caswall will deliver this into your Grace's hands, 
          to whom I have sent all the papers referr'd to in my last to be 
          deliver'd to your Grace, wheh you'll please to order him to 
          attend you with them etc. (v 11th Jan.). Continues : These 
          things are the whole of what I have ever done respecting 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's Fort</placeName>etc. Continues : 
          You'll find among these papers the copy of a memorial I made to the King and deliver'd 
          into your Grace's hands when I had the honour to take leave 
          of your Grace at <placeName ref="en_lon_newcastle" role="secondary">Newcastle House</placeName>, 15 May last, to which I should 
          have been glad of an answer. But never reciev'd one word 
          till H.M. order of 12th Nov. last came to my hands. In that 
          Memorial your Grace will find cited a clause of the Royal Charter 
          of this Province, making the lands at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> a part of this 
          Province, and agreeable thereto they are contain'd in H.M. 
          royal commission to me for this Government. Quotes from 
          Commission directing him to act according to the Charter. 
          Continues : How dare I then disobey H.M. etc. by refusing a 
          legal protection to his good subjects when they apply to me for 
          it. These riotters have been since legally convicted in H.M. 
          Courts, and must doubtless undergo the penalties of the law 
          for the breach of H.M. peace, and so notorious an assault and 
          riott etc. As H.M. Governor he will see a good execution of 
          his laws etc. Continues : Nothing can appear more false than 
          Collo. Dunbar's saying I was preparing a military expedition 
          against Frederick's Fort etc., nor did anything like it ever enter 
          into my thoughts. It is also false in him to say no private 
          persons have hitherto set up any claim to those lands, because 
          there have been a great many claims made and are made daily, 
          and the people that claim think they have a just right (tho' 
          not by any grant of this Province) and one of the men whom 
          Collo. Dunbar's people riotted and assaulted has a claim there 
          descended down to him for 105 years etc. v. 11th Jan. [encl. i]. 
          Continues : Every man's property is his life, and I can't answer 
          for people's giving away what they think their own, but for the 
          right of this Government to those lands according to the Royal 
          Charter. Had Collo. Dunbar wisely manag'd about them I 
          think I should have had influence enough with this Assembly 
          to have made a cession of their right to the Crown, and it was 
          always my opinion that it would be greatly to the advantage 
          of this Province, that the Crown should settle those lands. Yet 
          etc., I know not how to answer those that say, the Crown has 
          always supposed those lands to be a part of this Province, or 
          why have the Governours of the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts</placeName> been ordered 
          from time to time to insist with the Assemblies to rebuild the 
          fort at Pemaquid, they say, why have not the Governours of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">New Hampshire</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="indirect">Nova Scotia</placeName> had those Instructions, and 
          again the King has directed the choice of a Councellour in the 
          Royal Charter to be chosen, on account of those lands, and who 
          of course becomes one of the legislators of H.M. Province of the 
          Massachusetts Bay, and without such a Councellour the present 
          Constitution cannot subsist. My Lord Duke, I should be glad 
          I say to be instructed how to answer these things. But that 
          Gentleman has made himself so obnoxious to this countrey in 
          general, that I can attempt nothing with hopes of success, 
          where he has any concern. I humbly beg of your Grace, that 
          at no time any complaint may take effect to my prejudice till 
          I have time to make answer thereto for as it is the undoubted 
          right of the meanest Englishman to be heard upon any accusa- 
          tion, much more must it be the right of the King's Govr. whom 
          H.M. in his royal Instructions is pleas'd to call the representative 
          of his own person here. And I think Collo. Dunbar ought to 
          observe a decency to a Gentleman who has the honour to bear 
          so great a Commission from the King, yet I shall in my next 
          show to your Grace how rude he has been on this head. I 
          believe a short time will discover how little prudence he has, 
          and consequently of how little service he can be to the Crown, 
          in bringing forward the designed settlements. I hope always 
          My Lord Duke, to maintain the character of an honest man, 
          and I must assure your Grace it has been impossible for me to 
          do more from my arrival to this day, than I have in support of 
          H.M. honour and dignity, and for the interest of his British 
          Dominions, as well as for the Provinces under my care etc.

          Governor Worsley to the Council of Plantations.
          Encloses following : Is not able to send the Treasurer's account 
          of the 2s. Qd. levy of 1730, he not having made up his account 
          which does not end till the 19th instant. Continues : Your 
          Lordships will observe in my Speech to the Council and Assembly 
          I gave them a hint of finding some expedient at this present 
          juncture in relation to the payment of the arrears due to H.M. 
          upon the 2s. Qd. levy, what I have mentioned to some particular 
          Gentlemen is that they would pass a bill in the preamble of 
          which they might make their submission to H.M. on account 
          of their past faults, and to oblige those persons to pay their 
          levy for the two last years who have not done it, and to have 
          prayed H.M. to remit the fines and forfeitures that have been 
          incurred. Tho I could not nor did not propose to pass such a 
          bill yet I could have transmitted it home for H.M. most gracious 
          commands thereon, and if H.M. would have been pleased to 
          have remitted the fines and forfeitures and to have allowed me 
          to pass it, I believe it would have made the whole island easy 
          tho' most of the Assembly as I am told are convinced that what 
          they have done is erroneous yet dare not make use of this 
          expedient for fear of the people, who would then see they have 
          been deluded ; unless they were ordered so to do, however they 
          are so unaccountable in their conduct that I can be certain of

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. As I have allways endeavour'd 
          to protect and countenance H.M. Patent Officers and their Deputies 
          in <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">this Island</placeName>, I am sorry I 
          should have any occasion of complaining to your Grace against 
          any one of them especially Messrs. Reynolds the Provost 
          Marshall whose Patent three years ago was struck at by the 
          complaints that were made to me against their Deputy by the 
          same party, that they are now endeavouring to serve, and had 
          I not then conducted it, as I did, perhaps it would not have been 
          in the Patentees power now to have acted as they of late have 
          by putting in such Deputys, as I apprehend cannot be for H.M. 
          service, in that they have been supported, and recommended 
          to them by those, who have opposed the payment of H.M. tax 
          here, and have said, as I am informed, they would have officers 
          of their own. Refers to enclosures. Continues : I find Capt. 
          Kennedy has discover'd in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, what I have a long time 
          suspected here ; the persons they have deputed, are Mr. George 
          Gascoigne and upon his death, or absence or disability of acting 
          Mr. Thomas Granger, who is at present Deputy Clerk of the 
          General Assembly, and therefore a most improper person for 
          that office. Mr. Gascoigne did not pay H.M. tax the year before 
          the last, as your Grace will see by authentick copys of the 
          Treasurer's account, enclosed, and the last year he did not give 
          in number of his negroes etc. Their design is to get all the 
          Deputy's to the Patent Officers, and I am told are now endeav- 
          ouring to prevail with Mr. Whitworth to appoint a Deputy 
          Secretary in the room of Mr. Webster. Upon the perusal of the 
          above-mentioned letters, your Grace will observe the artifices 
          that are made use of to make me uneasy in my Government. 
          Mr. Ashley's mandamus not being come according to his 
          expectation, and as he gave out it would, has much disappointed 
          the party who opposed the payment of H.M. tax, and I can't 
          help mentioning to your Grace that several Gentlemen upon 
          that occasion have said, that if mandamus's come to those who 
          oppose the paying H.M. tax, what must we do then. With 
          this your Grace will receive a list of those persons names, who 
          ought to have paid the 2s. Qd. levy the year 1729 but did not, 
          as also the late Treasurer's account for the said levy for the 
          same year, in which are particularly mentioned the names of 
          those persons of every parish, who did pay etc. Continues : 
          Whether Mr. Ashley has paid since, I cannot tell, in that the 
          present Treasurer has not made up the last year's account, but 
          if he has it is probably to avoid paying the penalty, because 
          Mr. Cornor one of the then Assembly-men for <placeName ref="#bb_stphilip" role="direct">St. Phillips parish</placeName>
          had returned him as a defaulter. H.M. Council here having 
          rejected the Assembly's bill appointing Messrs. Forster, and 
          Leheup their Agents, the Gentlemen of the Assembly and others 
          have agreed as I am informed to fix them their Agents, and by 
          voluntary contribution have raised the same sallary, as was 
          appointed by the said bill, and Mr. Peers their Speaker to 
          correspond with them and have left it to Mr. Leheup, that 
          whether he appears, or does not appear publicly, as one of their 
          Agents, as he shall judge it most for their interest, the Gentle- 
          men concerned will look on him, as one, and make their 
          acknowledgments accordingly to him. Concludes as preceding 
          first letter to Council of Trade. Signed, Henry Worsley. 7 pp. Enclosed, </p>

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. Since
          the sealing of a letter to your Grace this morning, I have received 
          an authentick copy of the Minutes of Assembly of yesterday, 
          tho' I must observe there was but twelve of the twenty-two 
          members present. What is mentioned in their second motion, 
          is in relation to a late election for a vestry for <placeName ref="#bb_stphilip" role="direct">St. Phillips parish</placeName>, 
          betwixt Mr. Weeks one of H.M. Council here, and Mr. Ashley 
          etc. (v. encl. i). Continues : The law of elections for Assembly- 
          men, and Vestrymen obliges all the voters to take the oaths 
          appointed to be taken instead of the oaths of Allegiance and 
          Supremacy. Mr. Ashley and Mr. Culpeper brought one 
          Coupman a Roman Catholick to vote, Mr. Weekes insisted upon 
          his taking all the present State oaths, Mr. Ashley affirmed that 
          by the law of elections he was obliged to take the oaths appointed 
          to be taken instead of the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy. 
          Mr. Weekes refused the said Coupman to vote, and Mr. Culpeper 
          another of the candidates of the same side with Mr. Ashley has 
          prefered a petition etc. (encl. i), which is to be heard in Council. 
          This law of election was made in Mr. Cox's presidentship, and 
          if the oaths, the voters are to take, do not extend to the 
          abjuration, and the test, the said oaths were appointed to let 
          in Roman Catholicks, and others to vote at the said elections. 
          The affidavit I have inclosed etc., will set this matter in its

        <p>Deposition of Thomas Pickenden, Commander of the ship New Hampshire.
          Whilst he was at <placeName ref="#us_me_falmouth" role="direct">Falmouth</placeName> [[ed - CSPC errantly locates Falmouth in NH]],
          some of Col. Dunbar's men seized a sloop near <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemmaquid</placeName>
          (where Col. Dunbar was about making settlements), which
          was about to load some staves, and threatened to shoot
          the master if he made any opposition. The master proceeded
          to <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName> for justice.
          The Governor ordered the Justices of <placeName ref="#us_me_york" role="indirect">York</placeName>
          in the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="indirect">Province of Maine</placeName> to take such measures as they
          thought best etc. They ordered the Sheriff, Major Moulton,
          to arrest Dunbar's lieutenant. On Oct. 8th last the said Sheriff
          of York with some men under his command on board a sloop
          bound for Pemmaquid put in by contrary winds to <placeName ref="#by_casco" role="direct">Casco Bay</placeName>.
          Deponent was assured there was not any intent or order to drive
          off the people which Coll. Dunbar had settled there, and that
          those people had given out they would be the death of Moulton
          if he came to Pemaquid or their settlement. Signed, Thos. Pickenden. Copy.

        <p>Winchelsea In <placeName ref="#en_thedowns" role="from">the Downs</placeName>.
          Capt. Waterhous to Mr. Popple. Encloses following answers.
          Continues : The Fishery at <placeName ref="#ca_ns_canso" role="direct">Canço</placeName> is manag'd after 
          a manner different from that practis'd in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName>;
          for, instead of boat-fishing, it's wholly carry'd on by imbarkations. 
          call'd scooners, who are on the banks, sometimes a fortnight, 
          more or less as winds and weather present, so that it's impossible 
          the fish can prove so good as those brought in every day, which 
          is done by boat fishing ; but that can't be expected till the 
          place is settled with proper inhabitants, that can tarry there 
          winter and summer, which at present, is otherwise, the <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> 
          people having most of the property : They come in the 
          spring, and about the beginning of September return to New 
          England again, leaving two or three hands in each property 
          till next spring to provide for the flake, which are in very good 
          order etc. The place is extensive and full of islands, which are 
          very commodious for the Fishery, but there are wanting fortifi- 
          cations to secure even those that are now on that employment, 
          in case of a rupture with the Indians, or, our neighbours, the 
          French, for not above four leagues cross the <placeName ref="#by_chedabucto" role="direct">Gulph of Canço</placeName>,

        <p>Answers to preceding by Capt. Waterhous. 22nd
          Jan., 1730/1. (i, ii) The inhabitants are possess'd of 
          no stages, cook-rooms, or train-fats, their business 
          being wholly employed in curing fish, very little oil is made at
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns_canso" role="direct">Canço</placeName>. (iii) No aliens or strangers do 
          resort to <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>, or islands adjacent thereto to 
          take bait, trade, or fish on any account whatsoever in 
          those parts, (iv) The fishermen are wholy supplyed 
          from <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> with the manufactures of the 
          Kingdom, either by British ships trading to Canço 
          etc. or from <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName>. I cannot find that they 
          are supply 'd with anything from foreign countries, 
          except what the New-England-men bring for their 
          own subsistence, (v, vi) The wages for carrying on 
          the fishery at Canço alters, some going by shares, and 
          others by the season, but mostly by what they catch, 
          so that the industrious man gets most : they are 
          commonly paid by bill ; or take up necessaries they 
          have an immediate occasion for ; but the charge of 
          fitting out and maintaining a scooner is uncertain, the 
          men having half they catch, and the owner, who finds 
          ware, tare, salt and provisions, has the other half, 
          (vii) The fishermen have no employment for their 
          people, but wholly to catch fish, the shoremen curing 
          them. The fishing scooners commonly carry five men 
          each ; the fish they afford at a settled price, viz. this 
          year at 40s. p. quintal New England money. I must 
          observe to you, that no topmast vessel does catch fish 
          in those parts, for its morally impossible any vessels 
          but scooners can do on this coast. There was not one 
          top-mast vessel there this year, (viii) By the latter end 
          of September all the fishermen go to New England in 
          their scooners (perhaps two or three men left to look after 
          their houses and flakes), to provide for the next season, 
          (ix, x) No houses of the inhabitants interfere with the 
          Fishery, but all contiguous to themselves, their flakes 
          as nigh the water-side as possible, and so run up in 
          the country as far as they have hands to manage 
          them ; the length uncertain ; just as the nature of 
          the ground will allow ; every man being allotted his 
          proportion of ground pr. Governor Philips. Their 
          flakes are in very good order and room enough, (xi) 
          The British ships that come from <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> for a sack 
          at Canço are victuald from Britain, and some bring 
          provisions to sell to the fishermen, (xii) There is 
          no such thing as ships making their own cargoes of 
          fish, (xiii) Taverns or publick-houses in Canço about 
          11, which are contiguous to the garrison for the benefit 
          of the soldiers, (xiv) As to their remaining as servants 
          to the inhabitants, there is no such thing ; for the 
          Proprietors and scooners with their crews go home 
          about Sept. etc. v. Art. viii. (xv-xvii) No servants 
          are brought from England as is practis'd in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName>.
          As for thefts and disorders there are very few, 
          at least when I was there, considering 130 scooners, 
          whose crews make up 650 men. Some debauch'd 
          people must be expected among such a number. The 
          people left behind last year were about 50 exclusive 
          of garrison, and about the same this year, (xviii) The 
          New England men do steal away some of the seamen, 
          but when detected severely suffer for it ; but they 
          are now more cautious, because I made an order, and 
          declar'd I would make reprisals, which I did on one of 
          them, when one of our men deserted, (xix) I can 
          answer for this year, what fish has been ship'd will 
          turn out well (if they have not a bad passage), con- 
          sidering the bad season, not having a fish day above 
          once in three weeks, that is, a day for hardning the 
          fish for shipping. As for their taking care in well 
          curing the fish, there is no industry wanting when 
          opportunities offer ; for their whole dependance is 
          upon their goodness ; and it's my opinion the masters 
          are more in fault than the shore-men to take fish, when 
          they know they are not thoroughly cured, (but I have 
          endeavour'd to put things to rights this year) which, 
          in some measure, may have been the occasion of 
          former complaints from the merchants. I have made 
          an enquiry of the manner of curing the fish, which is 
          as follows, vizt., they allow 10 hogsheads of salt to 
          100 quintals of fish, which I think very sufficient ; for 
          if they allow more in the hot season they would be 
          salt-burn'd, which is a great loss : and as to fish caught 
          in the spring, they cannot be much prejudic'd, except 
          in colour, which can't be so bright as the Newfound- 
          land fish that are caught in boats ; for the scooners 
          are commonly out a fortnight or ten days, according 
          as winds and weather present : but in hot weather they 
          run hazard ; for then some fish will be salt-burn'd 
          when they are brought on shore ; and there is no help 
          for it, tho' it is the occasion of some turning out 
          refuge fish, which is a great loss to them. The whole 
          fishery is carry'd on by the New England people in 
          embarkations, call'd scooners, which are the only 
          vessels to fish on this coast, and indeed it's the only 
          way at present they not employing any boats, tho' 
          its an excellent place for boat-fishing ; but that can't 
          be expected till settlements are fix'd by people that 
          can remain there summer and winter, which, for want 
          of proper fortifications, is at present neglected, their 
          properties not being secured to them, (especially on 
          the main) in case of the Indians breaking with us, 
          which at present we are under no apprehensions of, 
          tho' they are a sullen and treacherous people and it's 
          possible, on their breaking, they may destroy the whole 
          Fishery. The garrison being pin'd up to defend them- 
          selves, the Indians may come with numbers of canoes 
          to the back of the Fishery, and do the mischief, not- 
          withstanding the garrison, by reason the garrison 
          must have boats to transport them from one island to 
          the other ; and their way of attacking is commonly 
          in the night, they knowing every inch of the land. 
          (xx) As to the number of French ships at <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="direct">Cape Breton</placeName>, 
          and on that coast, there are, this year, 50 sail ; some 
          years they have 70 sail. I can't find any Irish Papists 
          settled among the French, at least I have not heard 
          of any, they never appearing nigh our port, and 
          whenever I meet any of their boats, nigh Can9o, they 
          presently go off. (xxi) I can't find any of the officers 
          of the garrison at CanO concern'd, in the least, either 
          of themselves or others, in the Fishery, but the whole 
          carried on by the Proprietors, who have houses and 
          rooms, which they leave with two or three persons to 
          take care of in the winter, neither do they hire out the 
          soldiers to fish. Signed, Tho. Waterhouse. Endorsed

          Governor Hunter to the Duke of Newcastle. Venture 
          this by a Bristol ship which is to sail tomorrow morning and 
          it serves only to acquaint your Grace of the safe arrival of the 
          Enterprize Capt. Smith on the 18th of this month by whom I 
          had the honour of two of your Grace's letters of the 9th of Nov., 
          1730. On the 26th of last month the Adventure Lord Muskery 
          Capt. sailed from <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName> bound for 
          <placeName ref="#cu_havana" role="direct">Havana</placeName> where he is to 
          take on board that part of the treasure of the Genoesa which the 
          Spanish Capt. en second De la Hay now in prison at Havana had 
          carried off with him (in a sloop belonging to <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this island</placeName> which 
          was sent him to save the crew) and then to proceed for <placeName ref="#es_cadiz" role="indirect">Cadiz</placeName>; 
          but of this Rear Admiral Stewart by who's orders his Lordship 
          acts will give your Grace a more particular account. Encloses 
          account of the treasure (No. i) etc., " which I had this morning 
          from Mr. Stewart." Continues : On the first advice I reced. 
          of H.M. orders to send two regiments forthwith from <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">Gibraltar</placeName>
          for the defence of this his Island, which indeed wanted it much, 
          I by proclamation call'd the General Assembly to meet on the 
          21st of this month, being prorogued to a longer time. They 
          met, but not in a number to proceed to business, desired leave 
          to adjourn to Monday the 26th instant, which was granted them ; 
          I wish and am not without hopes that they may make suitable 
          returns for H.M. care of their safety at a time when it is apparent 
          that they are in no condition to take care of themselves. All 
          who have anything here to care for and no views of bettering 
          their fortunes by changes rejoyce with hearts full of gratitude 
          for this timely succour and protection when they least expected 
          it. Mr. Stewart sends the Tartar to cruize to the windward 
          with my orders to the Officer commanding the troops on board 
          the transports which will be in conformity with the advice of 
          Council (end. ii). I hope they bring tents with them ; I have 
          however sent orders to <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, to make preparation for 
          their reception by repairing the old and building new hutts and 
          barracks. A small party sent out from the leeward brought 
          in a negro woman prisoner who has informed as in the paper. 
          (No. iii). There can remain no doubt of their correspondence 
          with and encouragement from the Spaniards. And I am affraid 
          they have the same with and from some within. The paper 
          mark'd (No. iv) is the copy of a letter from Lehy at <placeName ref="#ie_dublin" role="direct">Dublin</placeName>
          brought to my hands by our Attorney General, having by 
          mistake been delivered to the Executor of Mr. Murray deceas'd 
          by reason of the resemblance of the names Morrogh and Murray. 
          The original I shall send by Capt. Smith, that your Grace, if 
          yo(u) think fitt, may be better inabled to inquire after and find 
          out the writer. Last Monday one Tuder who has the command 
          of the party now fitting out against the slaves in rebellion on 
          the North East of this island, and the fittest man for that 
          command, having behaved himself well on that service when 
          others fail'd, was arrested at <placeName ref="#jm_kingston" role="direct">Kingston</placeName> where his party were 
          rendezvous'd for a petty debt contrary to law being a freeholder, 
          and kill'd in the Marshall's house by a shott behind him, two 
          of his party kill'd and some wounded at the door by the 
          Marshall's men, who are all here now in goal, the Coroner's 
          inquest having found the fact willfull murder. Of this I shall 
          be more particular by Capt. Smith. No. v is a copy of the last 
          letter I reced. from the General of the gallions etc. I have 
          desired Mr. Stewart to keep the Enterprize here a few days that

          the Assembly shall enter or resolve upon for the accommodating 
          and providing for the two regiments etc. Signed, Ro. Hunter.

          Governor Hunter to Mr. Popple. On the 16th of this 
          month I received by the Hannibal their Lordships' letter of 
          Oct. 22nd. Tho' I gave my assent to an act repealing the 
          Protestant act, chiefly because of the objection against it at 
          that board ; yet I believe every friend to the King's Government 
          in <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this Island</placeName> are sensible of the obligations they ly under to 
          their Lordships' for recommending the first to his Royal appro- 
          bation. Their danger from Irish Papist avow'd or conceal'd 
          having been greater than they apprehended so, much need not 
          be said to perswade their Lordships to get this repealer dis- 
          approv'd. They may perhaps amend it by a subsequent. The 
          very Faction itself would be ashamed on this side to say that 
          I had or possibly could have any views of putting my son's 
          names in patents for land at <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="indirect">Port Antonio</placeName>, but that of 
          encouraging others to become settlers, and if I could have don 
          it without discouraging such, I would have long ago removed 
          the negros I have there, which I leave a sacrifice to that view, 
          and have offered these or any other lands thereabouts in my 
          power or the King's grant to any person who will settle there 
          with the same number of negros, and these lotts are in partner- 
          ship with Col. Nedham the best settler of new ground here, 
          and he well knows the truth of what I say. I am surpris'd 
          at what their Lordships write about the old Seal, it was seal'd 
          up in Council, put into a box together with the Acts of Assembly 
          etc. and sent on board of the Plymouth, Capt. Bridge, 10th May 
          last by one of the Marshals, who brought a receipt for the 
          same, but I can not account for or guess at the cause of the 
          miscarriage. I hope before this time it may be found out. 
          This goes by a British ship which sails to-morrow morning, so 
          that I have not time to write as I ought to their Lordships, 
          but by Capt. Smith of the Enterprise which will sail in a few 
          days and is kept here on purpose their Lordships will hear from 
          me directly, in the mean time you may communicate what you 
          please of this. Signed, Ro. Hunter. Endorsed, Recd. 19th

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. When I was last
          in the Provinces of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>
          I did in obedience to H.M. royal instruction order a survey of the onely fortification
          there call'd the <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">William and Mary fort</placeName>
          etc. Report enclosed wherein it is proposed to repair and add to the fort, 
          and to raise a battery of six guns in another place. Continues : 
          The Assembly also propos'd to me the building of a Court 
          House at <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">Portsmouth</placeName> the capital of the Province. H.M. Council 
          and the House of Representatives past a bill, for raising 6000£. 
          to defray the charge of these things, and at the same time to 
          postpone the payment of 150,000£. and 1730£. now out on a 
          loan ; to this bill I could not give my consent, because I suppos'd 
          it to interfere with H.M. 22nd and 23rd Instructions to me : 
          But I promis'd to send the bill to your Grace, and to humbly 
          crave in their behalf, that your Grace would procure and send 
          me H.M. royal leave to give my consent to the bill, which is 
          inclosed. I am with great submission to your Grace of opinion, 
          that the bill can be of no prejudice but will greatly advance 
          H.M. honour and interest and the safety and prosperity of his 
          good subjects there, etc. Finding H.M. Council at New 
          Hampshire very thin consisting one of eight persons etc., and

          Spanish pirates, or rovers, were carried into <placeName ref="#pr" role="direct">Porto Rico</placeName> etc. 
          where by the clemency of the English Factor residing there, 
          the said two persons were imployed by one Don Joseph Traheau, 
          a native of <placeName ref="#fr" role="descriptive">France</placeName>
          but a subject of <placeName ref="#es" role="descriptive">Spain</placeName>, in order to assist him 
          in navigating a small vessell which he purchased for the better 
          despatching of packetts then under his care for the <placeName ref="#cu_havana" role="direct">Havana</placeName> 
          where he was bound, who accordingly with the said two persons 
          embarked and sailing along the coast of <placeName ref="#cu" role="indirect">Cuba</placeName> the said two 
          persons took an opportunity to throw the said Traheau over- 
          board, and then run away with his vessell, one negroe man 
          servant that waited on him and all the goods on board which they carried to a place called
          <placeName ref="#is_turks" role="direct">Turks Islands</placeName> a moroon key near 
          the <placeName ref="#bs" role="descriptive">Bahama Islands</placeName>, where meeting with a Bermuda vessell 
          they embarked for these islands leaveing behind the Frenchman's 
          vessell, and upon their arrivall here information being made to 
          me of their villany, I caus'd them to be aprehended, one was 
          try'd, condemn'd and executed, the other who was thought 
          least culpable turn'd the King's evidence etc. Refers to enclosure. 
          Continues : I have used my utmost endeavours to discover 
          what effects the said Don Joseph Traheau had on board, but 
          can find nothing considerable except the said negroe, those 
          fue that have been found are now in my possession, and shall 
          be sent to the proper owners thereof assoon as I can be advis'd

          The act has been so long depending before the Board, that the
          memorialists were apprehensive their Lordships might have
          some objection to it. As they don't apprehend by your letter,

          Mr. Popple to Wm. Coleman. I have laid your letter 
          of this day's date before my Lords Commissrs. etc., and am
          commanded to acquaint you for the information of the gentlemen who desire
          the Chancery Act of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> should be confirm'd, 
          that their Lordps. have frequently had the same under their
          consideration, but do not apprehend they can be justified in
          advising H.M. to confirm it, because they have several objections
          to it, and tho' it be not usual in matters of so public a nature,
          for their Lordships to declare either their opinion or their 
          reasons for their opinion, to any person whatever, before they 
          shall have laid the same before H.M. ; Yet their Lordps. have 
          been pleased to command me to acquaint you, that they appre- 
          hend the principal grievances complain'd of and intended to be 
          remedied by this act, may be effectually redress'd by H.M. 
          Instructions to His Govr. of the <placeName ref="#leeward" role="indirect">Leeward Islands</placeName>;
          and if any inconvenience should arise from the execution of those 
          Instructions, they may from time to time be alter'd and amended 
          as the benefit of the subject may require ; but it would not be 
          so easy to redress any evil arising from the effects of an act once 
          become absolute by the Royal approbation. That there is a 
          very extraordinary clause contained in this act, whereby it is 
          attempted to exclude the jurisdiction of all the Courts of 
          Judicature in <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>, except that of H.M. in Council 
          upon appeals. If therefore the Memorialists have anything 
          to lay before their Lordships, or desire to be further heard upon 
          the subject matter of the said act, their Lordships will be ready 
          to hear them on Thursday next. [C.O. 153, 15. pp. 67-69.]</p>

        <p>Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. Quote 
          from Governor Philipps' and Col. Dunbar's Instructions as to 
          laying out lands. Continue : But they having represented 
          to us, that, if they are obliged to follow the letter of these 
          Instructions, it would be a great discouragement to the settle- 
          ment of the Province, inasmuch as the finding out of proper 
          tracts of wood lands for the service of the Royal Navy would 
          require much time and consequently delay, if not disappoint, 
          the intention of such persons as may be at present disposed to 
          settle in <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>, more particularly great numbers of 
          Palatines and Irish Protestants, who are now willing and 
          desirous to become planters there ; we take leave humbly to 
          propose to your Majesty, in order to remove this obstacle, that 
          Colo. Dunbar may be impower'd, notwithstanding the said 
          Instructions, so soon as he shall have mark'd out any quantity
          of woodlands for the service of your Majesty's Royal Navy, 
          to set out an equal quantity of land not fit for that service 
          for such persons as shall be disposed to settle etc., always taking 
          care, that the lands, for the use of the Royal Navy, be first 
          mark'd out, and that those intended for private settlements 
          be on such lands only as are not fit for the service aforesaid ; 
          by which means the service of the Royal Navy will be 
          effectually provided for, and the settlement of this Province 
          may at the same time go forward etc. Propose to prepare 
          Instructions to them accordingly. [C.O. 218, 2. pp. 224-226.]</p>

          we presume your Grace will have very few applications for that employment, which is

          we do this purely out of regard to H.M. service, because we

          Lewis Bonnet to Mr. Delafaye. Warns him against 
          Mr. White, who has joined with Mr. Colebrooke to embarrass 
          the Governor for their own ends. Continues : Mr. Colebrooke 
          was chosen Speaker of the Assembly in which were several of 
          his creatures, so that by his artifice, and the ignorance of the 
          majority of the members, he carryed everything as he pleased, 
          and Mr. White being a great talker in the Council, most of 
          which were the old inhabitants and illeterate, they two consulted 
          their measures with the Assembly so as to be continually 
          pushing forward their own views, by which means they soon 
          began to lord it over the people in a very haughty and imperious 
          manner and to oppose the Governor in everything they could, 
          espetially in his designs of repairing the fortifications etc. 
          Mr. Colebrooke by his logick and sophistry, which the people 
          were very much unused to, prevented their coming to any 
          resolution about it, and Mr. White exerted himself to the same 
          purpose in the Council, which appearing very plain to the 
          Governor upon receiving a very extraordinary message from 
          the Assembly, he desired Mr. White and one Mr. Jenner another 
          tool of Mr. Colebrooke's to retire from the Council Board 
          into another room whilst he would acquaint the other 
          Gentlemen with something which he would not have them 
          enter into till it came to be debated in Council, they accordingly 
          withdrew and the Governor in a very little time sent for them 
          to take their seats, to enter on business, but Mr. White was 
          gone and hastened to acquaint the Speaker, Mr. Colebrooke 
          with this affair, and Mr. Jenner denyed to go in, saying Mr. 
          White was gone and he would go to etc. ut supra. Continues : 
          Upon this Mr. Colebrooke took upon him to harangue the 
          Members of the Assembly in a very extraordinary and seditious 
          manner, told them they were threatened with arbitrary power, 
          and bid them joyn with him and he would make an humble 
          address to H.M. that he would please to send them an honest 
          Governor who would act by law, and recall his tyrannical 
          and arbitrary Governor home, and amused the people with 
          speeches to this effect, and prevented their proceeding to do any 
          business till he had quite tired their patience, and the Governor 
          found it necessary to disolve them to lett the poor people go 
          about their private affairs since it was evident their Speaker 
          would divert them from doing the publick any service. As 
          soon as the Assembly was disolved, Mr. Colebrooke seized 
          upon all the books and papers thereof, and would not deliver 
          them to the Clerk, and afterwards denyed them to the Governor 
          in Council, who required them in order to send fair transcripts 
          home etc. Then Mr. Colebrooke applied himself to make a 
          party in the following Assembly, now sitting, and joyn'd himself 
          with the most ignorent of them in order to have a majority of 
          voices, and became reconciled to a man of whom he always 
          spoke with the utmost contempt, and who always represented 
          Mr. Colebrooke as one of the vilest of men, and the most 
          obnoxious to any civil Government, yett by giving him and 
          others large credit (out of the effects of some gentlemen at 
          home who intrusted him) and promises of more, he has got 
          them over to his side, and now he goes on very strenuously in 
          his old strain of opposing the fortifications being repaired, and 
          said publickly in the house at the first meeting of the present 
          Sessions that he always detested and abhorred the garrison etc. 
          Continues : The great opinion I have of the Governor's honour, and his constant endeavours 
          to promote the welfare of <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Colony</placeName>,
          and the very bad usage he has received from these two 
          persons who were both so much obliged to him, and Mr. White 
          being returning home on purpose to do him all the prejudice 
          he can, extorted this epistle from me etc. Signed, Lews.

          Governor Rogers to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. On the 11th Oct. last I had the honour to write
          your Lordships directly hence by Capt. Bankes, and sent a 
          duplicate of the same via <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName>. I have herewith by a direct 
          opportunity forwarded duplicates of the Acts of Assembly, 
          some of which I since have found are in some measure difficient
          through the ignorance of great part of our Assembly and artifice 
          of one person whom I had some confidence in or my first arrival 
          when the ill condition I found <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Colony</placeName> in did not allow me 
          time to weigh and deliberate on them with that circumspection

          I endeavoured pursuant to H.M. Instructions to recommend 
          the state and condition of the fortifications, which much wanted 
          all the assistance possible for their repair etc. (v. 11th Oct. 1730). 
          I did not find the major part of the Assembly averse at first, 
          but since they have been diverted from their good intentions 
          by the insinuations of one Mr. Colebrooke, their Speaker, who 
          imposed so long on their ignorance, that I was obliged to disolve 
          them, lest his behaviour might influence them to fall into 
          schemes yet more contrary to the good of the colony and their 
          own safety. Another Assembly is lately elected and still find 
          the effects of the above Mr. Colebrooke's influence on the most 
          ignorant of them, who are the majority, and whom he has 
          possess'd with notions of their being subject to the garrison, 
          which he publickly declared in the House he always detested 
          and abhorred, stiling it an arbitrary power and what the[y] 
          ought to oppose, though I never heard any complaints against 
          the garrison since my arrival. And he also attempts to take 
          from the Officers, and such of the soldiers of H.M. Garrison as 
          are equally freeholders with the inhabitants the liberty of voting 
          in common with their fellow subjects, so that I perceive I am 
          to expect but little publick service from the resolves of the 
          present Assembly ; being mostly influenced by him to oppose 
          any support towards the work of the fortifications, in which 
          designs I found he was assisted by one Mr. White who was of 
          H.M. Council here, and an old acquaintance of Mr. Colebrooke's, 
          and acted in concert with him in his designs to the great prejudice 
          of this Government, in which I was enough confirmed by 
          messages from his accomplices in the Assembly opposing the 
          country's assistance towards the fortifications, for which reasons, 
          at a meeting, being willing to acquaint the rest of the Council 
          therewith, I, in the most friendly manner, desired him and one 
          Mr. Jenner (who followed the same measure and was a dependant 
          on Mr. Colebrooke) to retire into another room whilst I advised 
          with the other Gentlemen of the Council, telling them it was on 
          something I did not judge proper then to mention before them, 
          till I had discoursed the rest present who were for going on with 
          fortifications. This affair happening on our receiving an 
          extraordinary message from the Assembly relating thereto and 
          and after having conversed with five of the Board present 
          wch. did not take up a quarter of an hour's time, I sent to 
          desire Mr. White to joyn and make a board as usual, but found 
          he was gone to consult his friend the Speaker of the Assembly, 
          and upon his being duly summonded the next morning he 
          refused to attend, which he signified by a letter to that purpose, 
          whereupon having first taken the advice of the Council present 
          and believing it more for the quiet of the Colony that I should 
          suspend him without entring the reasons at that Board, which 
          on extraordinary occasions as I humbly presume this was, I 
          made use of H.M. permission according to my Instructions 
          till H.M. pleasure be further known, and suspended him from 
          acting as one of the Council till that time, leaving Mr. Jenner 
          to declare his intentions which he often has since and refused 
          to attend the Council, abiding by what he had wrote in concert 
          with Mr. White. I am not in a state of health nor have I time 
          by this conveyance to trouble your Lordships further on this 
          affair but shall by next conveyance which I depend will happen 
          very soon after this and hope to do it from Carolina. I have 
          published H.M. order of 25th Sept. etc., since when we have 
          lost two sloops from this port, one of which we hear is carried 
          into <placeName ref="#cu_havana" role="direct">the Havana</placeName>. I daily expect the masters will be here to 
          make regular complaints thereof as prescribed by H.M. said 
          orders. Two sixty gun ships with warlike stores are lately 
          arrived at the Havana and as I am informed by a vessel lately 
          arrived thence they have encreased the number of regular forces 
          in that city and garrison and that my Lord Muskerry in H.M.S. 
          Adventure lay there ready to sail in her passage from <placeName ref="#jm" role="indirect">Jamaica</placeName>
          to <placeName ref="#es_cadiz" role="indirect">Cadiz</placeName>, with the money aboard her which was saved out of the 
          rich Spanish wreck some time since lost near Jamaica. The 
          present ill state of my health which has been lately much 
          impaired obliges me to have recourse to H.M. permission of 
          going to South Carolina for change of air, from whence I hope 
          to return in three weeks or a month, and that one or two of H.M. 
          ships will accompany me thence in order to make a demand of 
          our vessels (taken by the Spaniards) pursuant to H.M. orders. 
          Mr. White etc. was some time Chief Justice in this Colony 
          appointed by me, in which he acted with partiality and I have 
          displaced him from that office. He comes home by this 
          opportunity and as he has misconstrued almost everything I 
          have endeavoured to doe for the publick service, I have reason 
          to believe he may also misrepresent my actions in some sort of 
          complaints from himself or others by his and Mr. Colebrooke's 
          instigations, which I cant here yet be apprised of ; and I entreat 
          your Lordships goodness that I may be allowed time to answer 
          to anything of that kind before it has made any impressions to 
          my disadvantage, having done everything here to the best of 
          my judgement for the service of the publick, and if I should 
          have inadvertently been guilty of any mistake, it has not been 
          thro' want of zeal for H.M. service and the welfare of this 
          Colony, in which I shall always act with that integrity that 
          becomes a man of honour deserving your Lordships patronage 
          and protection. Acknowledges Additional Instruction of 2nd

          Mr. Popple to Col. Dunbar. Acknowledges letters of 
          2nd and 25th May, 5th and 16th June, 19th Aug., 15th and 21st 
          Sept. and 21st Oct. Continues : My Lords Commissioners 
          would sooner have given me their directions in answer, but 
          that the great dispute, relating to the claim of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusets Bay</placeName> 
          and of several private Proprietors to lands in that part of 
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName> where you are, is not yet determin'd ; But as the 
          Sollicitor of the Treasury has with the approbation of My Lords 
          Commissioners for Trade and Plantations laid before the 
          Attorney and Sollicitor General a full state of this matter for 
          their opinion in point of law, who are now hearing Council on 
          both sides thereon, it will shortly receive a decision. In the 
          mean time you are at liberty to lay out <placeName ref="#us_me_sagadahock" role="direct">lands</placeName> as directed by your 
          Instructions between the rivers <placeName ref="#rv_penobscot" role="boundary">Penobscot</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#rv_stcroix" role="boundary">St. Croix</placeName> and 
          their Lordships wish you success in such settlements as you 
          shall make there : But until the King's title to the lands between 
          <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="boundary">Kennebeck</placeName> and Penobscot shall be finally determined, you are 
          not at liberty to make any settlements there. But as to those 
          which you have already made in the neighbourhood of <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName>, 
          you will perceive by the duplicate of an Order to the Governor 
          of <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> which was sent you some time ago, that H.M. 
          has been pleased to direct that they shall not be disturb'd till 
          his further pleasure shall be known. And if the right shall 
          appear upon enquiry, to be in H.M., we apprehend the people 
          you have settled there will never be disturb'd. All settlements 
          to be made at or near <placeName ref="#ca_ns_annapolisroyal" role="direct">Annapolis Royall</placeName>
          and Canço or in any other part to the N.E. of Santa Croix are left entirely to the 
          direction and care of Colo. Phillips and therefore you will have 
          nothing more to do there but lay out the lands pursuant to Colo. 
          Phillipps' directions, but this may be done by your Deputies 
          that you may have the more leisure to comply with the other 
          parts of your duty elsewhere etc. Although you are directed 
          by your Instructions to lay out another hundred thousand acres 
          of land between the Rivers Penobscot and St. Croix, yet you 
          are not confin'd to any particular place but may mark them out 
          according to the best of your judgement even in the different 
          parcels if necessary, always taking care not to incroach upon 
          private property, and my Lords do not doubt your integrity in 
          the execution of this trust, And whereas their Lordships have 
          observed by the copies of the letters between Col. Phillipps and 
          you which you transmitted to the Board relating to this part 
          of the execution of your trust, that great difficultys did occur 
          to Col. Phillipps in the peopling of Nova Scotia, in case such 
          persons as were desirous to take up lands there should be oblig'd 
          to wait till the whole three hundred thousand acres proposed to 
          be reserved for the service of the Royal Navy should have been 
          mark'd out and set apart by you for that use, their Lordships 
          have represented this matter to H.M. and expect shortly to 
          receive his directions thereon. " My Lords taking notice of the 
          discouragement which you apprehend it may be to the settling 
          of lands to the Eastward, that the title to those lands tho' layed 
          out by you may hereafter be lyable to dispute have commanded 
          me to direct you, that Col. Philipps is directed by his Instruc- 
          tions to affix the Great Seal of the Province of Nova 
          Scotia to all such allotments of land as you shall set out to the 
          westward of St. Croix, whereby the titles to such lands will 
          become indisputable, and when any number of allotments 
          shall be ready for the Great Seal they may be sent all together 
          to Col. Philipps for his confirmation. My Lords Commissioners 
          have commanded me to send you a copy of the petition which 
          Mr. Waldo has presented to the King in relation to such claims 
          as are set up against H.M. title to the land between the Rivers 
          Kennebeck and Penobscot that you may transmit to them what 
          informations you can upon that subject, tho the validity of 
          these claims may possibly be determined before this letter can 
          reach you. Their Lordships presume you have sent duplicates 
          to the Admiralty of those letters to me wherein you complain 
          of the difficulties you lye under of obtaining right in the Courts 
          of Admiralty in New England on seizures and condemnations 
          in behalf of the Crown ; However I have received orders to 
          transmit copies of your letters to the Admiralty, and my Lords 
          will readily concur with the Lords of the Admiralty in anything 
          that shall be proposed for redressing that grievance. My Lords 
          do not make you any particular answer to what you say in 
          relation to the settling the bounds between the Massachusets 
          Bay and <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, because the Governor of those 
          Provinces having received very full Instructions from H.M. 
          has already laid them before the Assembly of New Hampshire, 
          and we hope they may have a very good effect. It is with 
          great concern that My Lords Commissioners have read that 
          part of your letters wherein you mention the ill usuage you 
          have met with in the execution of your employment, and they 
          are sorry to find that you have put yourself to any expence 
          beyond what the duty of your office required of you, because 
          of the difficulty which must attend the application for repay- 
          ment, in a case where no fund is appointed for that purpose : 
          But if the money which you have expended for the publick 
          service shall really appear to have produced some advantage,
          My Lords are very willing to recommend the repayment thereof 
          to the Lords of the Treasury, and for the future it will be 
          prudent for you to be very cautious how you engage in any 
          expence beyond what you are directed to make. Upon this 
          occasion you particularly mention your expence in prosecutions 
          and your opinion that the Advocate and Attorney General 
          may be ordered to attend them to make their demands home, 
          and that the fines imposed might not only pay this charge but 
          afford some small salary or travelling charges for them. My 
          Lords take it for granted that it is the duty of all the King's 
          Officers to assist you in these prosecutions and would be willing 
          to propose the fines as a fund for this purpose had they not 
          upon your recommendation to the Lords of the Admiralty 
          prepared Instructions to the several Governors of the Colonies 
          which have since been approved of whereby the King's moiety 
          of all fines is given to the Informer. My Lords observe what 
          you have wrote concerning the construction which is put upon 
          those Acts of Parliament which impose fines upon offenders in the woods in 
          <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">America</placeName>, and for your information in this particular 
          I am commanded to send you a copy of Mr. Fane's opinion 
          whereby you will perceive that fines imposed by English Acts 
          of Parliament are deem'd to be and must be paid in sterling 
          mony. My Lords Commissioners are very sorry to find by your 
          letters that your health is so much impaired as to incline you 
          to think of resigning your employment, should you yet have the 
          same intention my Lords would very willingly at your request 
          propose your brother Mr. Jeremiah Dunbar for your successor ; 
          but as the nomination of this Officer is not in them you might 
          by this step run the risque of losing your employment and your 
          brother not succeed you : My Lords therefore hope your health 
          will return and that your dilligence and fidelity in the execution 
          of what you have now in charge may lay a foundation for 
          recommending you to a less painfull employment. My Lords 
          Commissioners having at your request transmitted to the 
          Lords of the Admiralty the proceedings of the Vice Admiralty Court at 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">Portsmouth</placeName> in the Province of New Hampshire, upon 
          an information exhibited by Arthur Slade, one of your Deputies 
          against Jeremiah Foolsom, for cutting ten white pine trees 
          without H.M. licence first had and obtained ; I am commanded 
          to inclose to you a copy of Dr. Sayer's opinion thereupon 
          whereby you will perceive that the person who prepared the 
          information against Foolsom laid the foundation for the decree 
          as it is pass'd, by admitting the said trees to have been cut 
          within the township of <placeName ref="#us_nh_exeter" role="direct">Exeter</placeName> which does not appear to have 
          been an offence within the Statute upon which the information 
          was grounded. You will therefore be more cautious for the 
          future in any prosecution upon the foot of this Act : But as 
          that pass'd in the second year of His present Majesty's reign 
          entitled an Act for better preservation of H.M. Woods in America 
          etc., is much more explicit, I am commanded to send you a copy 
          thereof for your better guidance in this particular. P.S. Since 
          the writing of this I have received and laid before my Lords 
          Commissioners your letter containing a narrative of your 
          proceedings from 17th Nov. 2nd Dec., which they will take 
          into consideration as soon as possible etc. [C.O. 218, 2. pp. 227-236.]</p>

          Governor Hunter to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. By this conveyance of the Enterprise, Capt. 
          Smith, Comr., I have the honour to acquaint your Lordships 
          that Capt. Dent arrived here on the 7th of this month with 
          four of the transports, the other two being arriv'd three days 
          before ; the officers are in good health etc. The Assembly now 
          sitting are come to some resolutions towards providing for them, 
          viz., that 20s. per week be paid to the commissioned officers and 
          5s. to private men after the provisions brought hither with them 
          are expended, for the Officers, from the day of their arrival here. 
          They have also resolv'd that 10£. pr. head be paid to officers and 
          soldiers for every rebel slave by them kill'd or taken alive and 
          are now preparing bills for the additional duty for one year 
          and a capitation of a shilling on slaves and three pence on cattle 
          for that expense besides the deficiency bill. I had before their 
          coming ordered all the houses that could be had at <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName>
          to be hired for their reception on their landing, but these upon 
          the view of their Quarter-Masters not being sufficient ; their 
          Officers thought it adviseable that they should continue on board 
          for a day or two till we could provide better, but hearing that 
          they began to sicken on board, I have ordered them to be landed 
          forthwith and what we cannot lodge at Port Royal to be sent 
          to <placeName ref="#jm_kingston" role="direct">Kingston</placeName> that we may discharge the transport.
          The Tartar was sent to cruize to windward with orders to the Officer commanding
          to detach six companys directly for <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName> 
          to save time and expense. They escaped him, I suppose in 
          the night and the cruizer is not yet return'd, but that number 
          shall be convey'd thither speedily, having on my first advice 
          ordered hutts and barracks to be built for them there, where 
          they are much wanted, the chief strength of the rebels being 
          near to that place. On the first of this month our Country 
          party fitted out for another attempt on these slaves set sail 
          from Port Royal for Port Antonio, under convoy, I have heard 
          nothing of them since, and expect little good from them, their 
          Commander of whom I had a very good opinion being arrested 
          contrary to law for a petty debt, and whilst in custody in the 
          Deputy Marshal's house barbarously murdered ; for which the 
          Marshal and his men are now in gaol in order for their trial next 
          Court. I am now very much busied in giving orders for the 
          repartition of the soldiers, it being judg'd by the Council, and 
          Assembly most for the service of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Island</placeName>  
          that they be barrack'd in several different parishes. I hope (by Capt. Dent

          Lordships the acts of this session etc. P.S. Capt. Brook who

          Lt. Governor Gooch to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Refers to account of negro conspiracy (v. 14th Sept., 1730). 
          Continues: Since which the negros, in the 
          countys of <placeName ref="#us_va_norfolk" role="direct">Norfolk</placeName> and
          <placeName ref="#us_va_princessanne" role="direct">Princess Anne</placeName>, had the boldness to 
          assemble on a Sunday while the people were at church, and to 
          chuse amongst themselves officers to command them in their 
          intended insurrection, which was to have been put in execution 
          very soon after : But this meeting being happily discovered 
          and many of them taken up and examined, the whole plot was 
          detected, for which the major part of them were severely 
          punished, and four of the ringleaders, on full evidence convicted, 
          have been executed. This, with the imprisonment and correction
          of some of the most suspected in the other parts 
          of the country, where the designs appeared not so far concerted, 
          have brought them now to be very quiet and submissive : But 
          as we cannot be too much on our guard against such desperate 
          combinations, I have ord'red the Militia to patrole twice or 
          thrice in a week to prevent all night meetings, and every man 
          to bring his arms to church on Sundays and Holydays, lest they 
          should be siezed by the slaves in their absence, if the same 
          mutinous spirit should be revived amongst them etc. By the 
          death of Colo. Page etc., there is a second vacancy at the Council 
          Board ; I hope the first is or will be speedily filled up by H.M. 
          appointment of Colo. Harrison whom I formerly recommended : 
          and I must heartily wish the second might be supplied by the 
          choice of Colo. Henry Armistead, a gentleman of a fair fortune 
          and character, and of the same county in which Colo. Page 
          lived ; and I am the more sollicitous for Mr. Armistead because that
          <placeName ref="#us_va_gloucester" role="direct">county of Glocester</placeName> is the most populous, 
          and where there are more negros than any other county in the Government, and 
          hath always had one sometimes more of the Council residing 
          in it, who had the direct command of the Militia, which in all 
          probability would not be very easie if put under the conduct 
          of another who had no estate or interest there. For these 
          reasons, as well as out of regard to the merit of Mr. Armistead 
          I humbly recommend him etc. But if Mr. Corbin's friends have 
          prevailed, and he is preferred to Colo. Harrison, or they still 
          insist on his being one of the Council, I must then intreat your 
          Lordships to interceed for Mr. Harrison in the place of Colo. 
          Page, postponing Mr. Armistead until another oppertunity ; 
          since the interest of the former in a frontier county, bordering 
          on the Indians, and where their impressions are generally directed, 
          may bring more advantage to the publick service, than the 
          inconveniency which may happen in the other county by Mr. 
          Armistead's present disapointment, if we must have Mr. Corbin. 
          I doubt not, my Lords, there are other persons here who on this 
          vacancy will endeavour (by some pretence or other, or by 
          forming of an interest among the merchants, perhaps a more 
          powerful application) to succeed Colo. Page. And I am appre- 
          hensive lest some posse[s]t with the ambition, whom I never 
          should have thought fit to insert in my list, do yet expect to 
          obtain it by an interest at home. But I beg your Lordships 
          will be pleased to allow some difference between a Governour's 
          personal knowledge and observation of the conduct and qualifi- 
          cation of men here on the spot, and the superficial knowledge 
          that can be attained by others, from an epistolary corres- 
          pondence ; or the judgment that can be framed of any person's 
          abilities in the Legislature of a country, and in dispensing of 
          Justice or the conducting affairs of Government, meerly from 
          the weight of his consignments. My Lords, the office of a judge 
          of the General Court, ought always to be considered in the choice 
          of a Councillor ; and it is the duty of a Governour to propose 
          none to be his assistants in the administration, but those whom 
          he knows zealous for H.M. service, and well disposed to promote 
          the publick good (especially now we are like to be under a new 
          law with respect to our trade, in which H.M. interest is so much 
          concerned) and admitting that he may sometimes be mistaken 
          in his men, it must be allowed strangers are more liable to be 
          imposed on ; and I cannot but lay it down as a principle founded 
          on reason and prudence, that in the choice of gentlemen for 
          publick offices, private affection ought not to be concerned, 
          unless there be sufficient ability and integrity in the person to 
          execute that trust, etc. Signed, William Gooch. Endorsed,

        <p>Mr. Leheup to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          H.M. Lt. Governour in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> having directed me as Agent 
          for that Province to apply for H.M. royal confirmation of the 
          act for amending the staple of tobacco etc., offers answers to the 
          objections of the Commissioners of Customs etc. (v. 29th Dec., 
          1730). They were framed upon hearing one side only without 
          the Agent's being made acquainted with them till a copy of the 
          letter was sent to him signed, though he had applyed and 
          attended for that purpose etc. Repeats Lt. Governor Gooch's 
          arguments v. 23rd July, 1730. Replies he could not have any 
          other view in recommending this act than remedying the great 
          frauds in the tobacco trade etc. (i) As the Gentlemen of the 
          Assembly are planters, they are the best judges of the benefits 
          that will accrue to their trade from this law. The 3s. Virginia 
          money to be paid for inspecting and nailing the hhds. etc. is 
          a very small additional expence. Planters already pay 25. 
          or more for nailing and weighting. It was so far from being 
          intended to discourage the lower planters that the only act 
          that might affect them was repealed at the time of making 
          this, that of limiting the number of plants to be raised by each 
          tythable. (ii) Mr. Carkesse omits mentioning that the Crown 
          pays 1/2d. pr. lb. for all the bad tobacco burnt here. The Crown 
          will be saved this and the planter the freight etc. The bad sort 
          is so far from being most in request here, that the buyers here 
          will not give more than the duty for it, the consequence of which 
          is that the importer is obliged to send it abroad and then the 
          whole duty is drawn back and lost to the revenue, (iii) The 
          master is obliged by the Act of Parliament to swear to the 
          marks and number of hhds. on board, but they never swear 
          to the weight, which is most material to the revenue etc. The 
          Lt. Governor thought he had done eminent service to the 
          revenue in passing this act. It is continued only for three years, 
          in which time the advantage from it will manifestly appear. 
          Prays the Board to recommend it for confirmation etc. Signed, 
          Peter Leheup. Endorsed, Recd. 22nd, Read 23rd Feb., 1730/1.

        <p>Lt. Governor Gooch to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Having last night received a copy of a report 
          transmitted to your Lordships from the Commissioners of H.M. 
          Customs etc. (v. 29th Dec. 1730). I am greatly surprised to 
          find that Board influenced by the misinformations of persons, 
          who either know nothing of the tobacco trade, or wilfully 
          misrepresent it etc. Offers some remarks on their report, which 
          will convince all indifferent judges, that this act for amending 
          the staple of tobacco will really increase H.M. revenue. Answer 
          to 29th Dec., 1730. (i) Almost all the tobacco made by 
          the common people, (and they make the best), is sold to the 
          merchants in this country and the factors from the out-ports, 
          for cloathing and other necessaries which the planters want etc. 
          Their manner of dealing hitherto hath been that if a planter 
          wants but a pair of shoes at one of these stores, he must lay 
          out a whole hogshead of tobacco, seeing the merchant will not 
          receive a less quantity, neither will he deal at all, unless the 
          tobacco lyes convenient to his Receiver ; and by this means 
          the poor planter is often obliged to take goods that are of little 
          or no use to him, and at what price his neighbouring storekeeper 
          pleases to impose, because he cannot otherwise have what he 
          really hath occasion for ; This has indeed proved a discourage- 
          ment to many industrious people, and must in time obliged them 
          to leave off planting, and apply their labour to better purpose. 
          But by this act the greatest encouragement is given to the 
          common people to make tobacco that could be then thought 
          of : for after their tobacco hath passed an inspection, they may 
          take as many notes for it as they please ; i.e., notes for fiftys 
          or hundred pounds, dividing their tobacco into what parcels 
          they think proper ; these notes, the same as money, will be 
          accepted as payment at any store or shop, and as it is much 
          easier for a planter to carry home his goods, than to remove 
          his tobacco to the conveniency of the merchant, he will not 
          henceforward be confined to one particular merchant, but will 
          be at liberty to deal where he can meet with the best goods and 
          the best purchase. These advantages being what the common 
          planters see their account in, they are, and will be, more 
          particularly fond of the method proposed for payment in these 
          transfer notes, and will thereby be incited to apply themselves 
          to this manufacture with greater attention than they have 
          hitherto done, under the disadvantage of being stinted in their 
          plants, a low price and an useless return. As to lessening the 
          consumption by advancing the price, I can see no ground to 
          apprehend such a consequence : for since the rich and even 
          people of middling fortunes will ever be fonder of smoking good 
          than bad tobacco, be the price what it will ; so custom having 
          made smoaking as necessary as food to the labourer and 
          mechanick, it will not be an half-penny, or penny pr. pound 
          that will lessen the consumption of what they find necessary 
          to the gratification of their desires : but 'tis rather to be expected 
          that a more agreable tobacco will draw them into a greater 
          inclination to use a much larger quantity : Besides, that which 
          is sold at a very low price in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>,
          to the poor people, is not tobacco, but the stalks flatted and cut up by the tobacconists. 
          A commodity which ought not to be vended, the prohibiting 
          whereof must be submitted to the wisdom of the British 
          Parliament, (ii) This is answered by the fact that the poor 
          planters make the best tobacco etc. Believes there was the same 
          quantity of tobacco consumed in England when it was sold at 
          10d. pr. lb., as now, when it is sunk to 8d. or 7d. If there is no 
          tobacco so bad as to deserve to be burned as unmerchantable, 
          the King's revenue must be increased proportionately etc. 
          Further discussion of fraudulent running of tobacco etc. Con- 
          tinues : I must now beg your Lordships to consider some of the 
          consequences which must unavoidably follow the disallowance 
          of this act. (i) As the Tobacco trade is sunk to that degree that 
          abundance of the planters are no longer able to live by it, and 
          are in some hopes of relief from the regulations now proposed, 
          if that fails, they must of necessity leave off planting or starve 
          for want of cloathing and tools to work with, (ii) The last 
          session there was a considerable party in the House that opposed 
          this act, also strongly insisted on reducing the quantity of 
          tobacco to be planted to no more than 3000 plants for each 
          tithable, which in the most favourable year would hardly 
          amount to 20,000 hhds. But as I assured them I could pass 
          no such act, I had the good fortune, I must still cal it so, to 
          prevail with them to try this experiment, in which everybody 
          here sees how much the interest of the revenue has been con- 
          sidered, and if we are so unhappy to be disapointed in this, I 
          know no other expedient, consistent with H.M. interest, to 
          keep up the spirits of the people from sinking into despair of 
          ever being able to retrieve the miserable circumstances into 
          which the continued bad price of their tobacco for several years 
          past hath plunged them. And it is to be feared that many 
          poor familys will desert the country and retire to the new 
          settlements that are making in <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName>  
          to get out of the reach of their creditors. And what effect this must have on H.M. 
          revenue as well as the British trade, I humbly submit to your 
          Lordships. I cannot but express my concern, with an aching 
          heart my Lords, that any private representation of the state 
          of <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">this Colony</placeName>, or the interest of the people, 
          with regard to H.M. advantage, should have more weight with the 
          Commissioners of the Customs, than the united and deliberate sentiments 
          of the whole Legislature : and for my own part, tho' I had some 
          share in carrying this act in the Assembly, yet, I shal be  
          contented to own myself in the wrong, if any just arguments can 
          be brought against it, but hitherto I have heard of none. Some 
          are prejudiced against it from private interest others fancie 
          they know more of the trade than they really do, etc., and a 
          few, who being used to a beaten path of business, are unwilling 
          to go out of their way, tho' they are led in to a better and an 
          amended road. Before I conclude your Lordships will suffer 
          me to do justice to myself. Under the late repealed law of a 
          stint (of 6000 plants per tithable etc.), the country in a favourable 
          year made 40,000 hhds. of good and bad tobacco which was 
          constantly sent to <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>. All rents, and publick dues, 
          as the Parish, the Country, and the Country levies, which the 
          planters are to discharge by an equal tax pr. tithable, were paid, 
          it will be believed, not with their best tobacco ; insomuch, to 
          instance in one article only, the King's quit-rents, tobacco, 
          with the inconveniency the buyers were under in collecting 
          such tobacco, was generally sold from 3s. to 5s. pr. cwt. at the 
          same time that the current price all over the country was 10s. 
          and 12s. at least. Under this new law, which leaves every 
          planter at liberty to make as much tobacco as he can, it is taken 
          for granted, that the Colony in a seasonable year will make 
          about 60,000 hhds., and 'tis imagined, if the Inspectors do their 
          duty, that one fifth part or more will be destroyed as trash. 
          By which method the 45,000, or it may be 48,000 hhds. passed 
          will be all very good and fit for any market, and out of this the 
          quit-rents and all other dues will be paid, and the publick 
          tobacco will then sell for as much money in the country or 
          elsewhere, as any other. 'Tis also proposed, that by the 
          goodness of the tobacco we shal encourage an increase of the 
          consumption : and this act, my Lords, as far as we are able to 
          guard against frauds, secures the duty of all that is consumed 
          in G. Britain to the King etc. Maintains that the advantages 
          of the Customs and the interest of the people are so linkt 
          together by this apt disposition, that 'tis impossible for man 
          to devise a better. The delay caused will prevent the first year 
          being a proper trial, but if any defects are revealed, future 
          Assemblies will remedy them etc. Signed, William Gooch.

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. By all 
          opportunities I have done myself the honour of transmitting 
          to your Grace the account of my proceedings etc. Continues : 
          Since my last I have conven'd a new Assembly, which has been 
          sitting near three weeks. Encloses Journal. They have still 
          under their consideration the matter of the Govr.'s support 
          and what they will finally do in it, I am not able to say. But 
          according to the best judgment I can make, I don't expect they 
          will do anything that will come nearer to the King's Instruction, 
          than what was done by the last Assembly. As I have not been 
          wanting to do everything in my power for the King's honour 
          and service, so I am still determin'd to pursue my duty to the 
          King in all the ways I possibly can etc. The Agrent will wait 
          on your Grace with the copy of the process of the Jourts against 
          the rioters mentioned 14th Jan. etc. Continues : I don't 
          suppose Collo. Dunbar's pride and malice would stick at any- 
          thing (whether true or false) he thought would hurt me, so I 
          hope your Grace will prevent any orders to me for the future 
          from anything Collo. Dunbar may write till I am serv'd with a 
          copy to make answer etc. Repeats request for leave to sign Act 
          of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">N.H.</placeName> for emitting 6000£. etc., and asks that Benjamin Gambling, 
          a gentleman of good vertue, estate and capacity, and perfectly 
          well attacht to the King may be appointed to the Council in 
          that Province. Signed, J. Belcher. 3 pp. [C.O. 5, 898. No. 82.]</p>

          13th Jan., 1731, on the trial of Samuel Hamble, 
          Thomas Lemont and two others, convicted for a 
          notorious riot in Sept. last, having seized a schooner 
          belonging to one Grover, who had put on board some 
          staves cut on a place possessed and improved by 
          Grover, his father and grandfather for 30 years, 
          Lemont etc. on a written order from Alexander 
          Hambleton, an officer under Col. Dunbar, who required 
          him to stop all such timber as should be cut and 
          transported from such a place without Col. Dunbar's 
          permission. They carried the schooner and stores 
          into <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> harbour.
          Grover and his crew fled in fear of their lives owing to their threats. The 
          vessel continued there till she was seized by Major 
          Moulton, High Sheriff of the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="indirect">County of York</placeName>, who 
          apprehended the rioters etc. Agrees that this was

        <p>Mr. Fane to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Reply to Feb. 19. I have reconsidered the acts of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> 
          referred to, and am humbly of opinion that H.M. cannot by any 
          instruction to his Governor vary or alter an Act of Assembly 
          ratified by the Crown, nor can H.M. in my humble apprehension 
          by virtue of an Instruction which the act of 1715 is observed 
          prevent his Governor granting or dissolving injunctions in causes 
          depending in Antigua whilst he is resident in any other island 
          of <placeName ref="#leeward" role="indirect">his Government</placeName>. Because as I am informed this practice 
          prevailed long before the act of 1715 took place : and I take 
          it that what was the usage in this particular before the act of 
          1715 is now by that act become a law of the island. It being 
          enacted by that law that all injunctions, subpoenas and other 
          process shall be granted signed and sealed by the Governour 
          as hath been usuall and no otherwise, and I know no method of 
          altering it, but by a subsequent law, and I begg leave to observe 
          to your Lordships that all regulations and amendments of the 
          law here have been made by Act of Parliament. Signed, Fran.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Duke of 
          Newcastle. Reply to 27th Feb. Continue : We do not find 
          anything in the papers your Grace has sent us, that shoud 
          incline us to alter our sentiments upon this subject, for not- 
          withstanding Mr. Belcher does in his letter deny that he ever 
          had any intention to march with an armed force in order to 
          demolish the fort at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName>, and carry away the people 
          prisoners from thence, yet he does not deny that he ever told 
          Colo. Dunbar, that some Members of ye Assembly had such an 
          intention, and he does likewise acknowledge that ye Sherrif 
          of <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">York County</placeName> did march thither with his posse about that 
          time, tho' upon a different occasion, which might very justly 
          give Collo. Dunbar reason to be alarm'd, and he certainly would 
          have been wanting in his duty to ye King, if in that situation, 
          he had not apply'd to H.M. for an order to prevent hostilities 
          till such time at least as H.M. title to that tract of land should 
          be determined. It is not to be doubted but that Colo. Dunbar's 
          Office as Surveyor of the Woods, as well as his Instructions for 
          settling ye <placeName ref="#us_me_sagadahock" role="direct">lands</placeName> betwen <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="boundary">Kennebeck</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#rv_stcroix" role="boundary">Croix</placeName> must have 
          rais'd him many enemies in <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">ye Massachusets Bay</placeName>, where it is 
          but too evident that every man who does his duty to the Crown, 
          makes himself liable to ye ill will of ye people ; and therefore 
          stands in need of all the support the Government can give him 
          from hence, for which reason it was, that we first beg'd your 
          Grace's favour on his behalf, and for ye same reason we now 
          take ye liberty to repeat that request, as apprehending that ye 
          employment of Lt. Gov. of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, may give him

          have heard of the defeat of the negros with an utter destruction

          attack'd them for an hour and a half without ever seeing one 
          of them, att length enter'd the town and after plundering itt, 
          laid itt in ashes, but took no one prisoner, this victory was 
          obtain'd with the loss only of two men. I believe we may now 
          naturaly conclude the war is over in this country. To-morrow 
          the companies of the two Regmts. march to the several quarters 
          alotted in the country, which I hear a miserable account of. 
          I have reason to beleive in some of them their will be wanting 
          both provisions and lodgings etc. The men now begin to be 
          verey sickly and die verey fast. By the inclos'd list of the

          Mr. Carkesse to Mr. Popple. Explains how the 
          Commissioners' report was framed without hearing Mr. Leheup. 
          They reply to his memorial (22nd Feb.). (i) As to the dirt, 
          rubbish which it is alledged the planters often mix with their 
          tobacco which tend to depreciate its esteem in foreign parts, 
          the officers in this port have met with no such instance, and if 
          the planters should do so, it would be no prejudice to the revenue 
          or any advantage to the importer, for it is liable to the same 
          duty as good tobacco, (ii) As to the great discoverys of frauds 
          that have been lately made here, for which great number of 
          officers have been dismist and others transported, the Commrs. 
          have good reason to believe that the prosecutions carried on have 
          put a stop to those frauds, but if not they do not apprehend 
          that a law passed in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName>, which can be of no force here, 
          can be any ways serviceable in preventing them, (iii) As to 
          ordinary or mean tobacco, the Commrs. are still of opinion 
          if by virtue of this law the importation thereof shoud be lessened 
          it will be prejudiciall to the revenue, it paying the same duty 
          as the best, tho' the revenue is not increased by what is shipt 
          off, yet the trade is thereby increased with the Northern countrys 
          they taking off great quantitys of this sort of tobacco, (iv) As 
          to the 1/2d. per lb. which the Crown pays for all bad tobacco burnt 
          here which charge Mr. Leheup says will by this act be saved, he 
          is misinformed, for the 1/2d. by law is not to be paid for such 
          tobacco as was damaged or unmerchantable in Virginia before 
          it was ship'd here, but only for such tobacco as happens to 
          receive damage by stress of weather or accident at sea etc., 
          which damage on ship board the Commrs. apprehend will 
          be increased by the Inspector's breaking the tobacco after it is 
          first packed before the shipping it being impossible to pack it 
          up again so close as it was at first, (v) As to the Navall Officer 
          sending over the exact quantitys of tobacco each ship takes on 
          board, there being no penaltys laid by this law as was observed 
          in my former letter, the Commrs. do not see any service 
          that can be to prevent the running of tobacco in <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>. 
          The other parts of Mr. Leheup's memorial relating to trade in 
          general, and not to this revenue, the Commrs. do not 
          think proper to make any observations thereon, but have 
          directed Mr. Fitzwilliams, Surveyor General for the Customs of 
          Virginia and other parts of the Southern Continent in America, 
          who has resided long in that country, and is an officer of whom 
          they have a very good opinion to wait on their Lordships to 
          answer such questions as they shall please to ask him relating 
          to this law etc. Signed, Cha. Carkesse. Endorsed, Recd. 12th

        <p>Mr. Fitzwilliam to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          In obedience to their commands has considered the Act of 
          <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> for amending the staple of tobacco, and con- 
          ceives it "to be highly prejudicial to the British merchants 
          trading to that country ; that it lays the poorer sort of planters 
          under such difficulties as in a short time must oblige them to 
          leave off planting, and betake themselves to some manufacture ; 
          that it vests such a power in Inspectors as no sett of men ought 
          to be entrusted with " etc. Explains at length. Mr. Leheup is 
          wrong in saying that the 3s. for stamps and nailing etc. will be but 
          a small expense to planters, for by the present custom of buying 
          nearly 4 lbs. of the tobacco pays nothing in the country for 
          weighing and nailing. Continues : As to what is alledged of 
          the planters being the best judges of what benefit will accrue 
          to their own trade, if that be admitted, yet I presume they are 
          not to be allowed proper judges of the Trade and Navigation of 
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> etc. If we look back but a very few years, we 
          may observe very extraordinary steps taken in the Governmt. 
          of Virginia to lessen, as much as in them lyes, both the revenue, 
          and the trade, by discouraging everybody from making tobacco, 
          in order to gain a monopoly etc. In 1726 there was a law passed 
          in Virginia for the more effectual preventing the bringing of tobacco 
          from N. Carolina etc., which is an effectual prohibition on 
          the people of <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="indirect">North Carolina</placeName> to plant tobacco. For that 
          province has no ports capable of admitting ships of burthen, 
          etc., and as Virginia has hitherto been the port from whence the 
          tobacco of that province has been conveyed to Great Britain, 
          the lessening of H.M. revenue must be the consequence of this 
          prohibition. But what makes the act still more extraordinary 
          is, that it is repugnant to an act of Parliament, notwithstanding 
          which, penalties have been recovered contrary to this act of 
          Parliament in the Courts of Common Law of Virginia, which 
          has lessened the importation of tobacco betwen 2 and 3000 
          hhds. yearly etc. Refers to his letter of Dec. 1727. Continues : 
          Upon an application made to the Parliamt. last sessions, the 
          law for preventing the importation of stemm'd tobacco, or 
          tobacco stripped from the stalk, was repealed, whereby the 
          quantity of tobacco usually stripped from Virginia was lessen'd 
          at least 6000 hhds. more, as may appear from the Customhouse 
          books, yet this indulgence, wch. consequently lessens the trade 
          of Great Britain to that country at least 20 sail of ships yearly, 
          had not satisfied them, but now in 1730 they pass this act of 
          their own, in order further to lessen the quantity of this com- 
          modity, whereby they propose to raise the price by preventing 
          the poorer sort of people from planting which must materially 
          give them a turn to manufacturing etc. As to the Lt. Governor's 
          interest in the act, besides his influence in settling the rent of 
          the warehouses, which is near equal to giving an employmt., 
          he will have the disposal of the new offices created by this act 
          to the value of near 6000£. pr. annum etc. Concludes : It is 
          generally computed that the execution of this act will cost the 
          country between 10 and 12,000£. a year etc. The inhabitants 
          have not yet been at any expense in building warehouses etc. 
          for executing it. There was a law of this nature in Virginia 
          called the Agents law, abot. 13 or 14 years agoe, which tho' 
          not near so bad in its consequences, was repealed as being 
          prejudicial to the trade of Great Britain. Signed, Rd.

          Capt. Coram to Mr. Popple. I have understood there 
          hath been some late enquirery about iron being made out of the

          and utensils of husbandry etc. of that country which I well

          of the vast great planks of oak and fir timber, and iron oar 
          which I found abounding at a place call'd <placeName ref="#us_ma_taunton" role="direct">Taunton</placeName>, on a

          much more by water, in some like manner as Winchester is

          shipwrights from Boston whome I had carryd. from <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">hence</placeName>
          thither thre years before for establishing shipbuilding in New 
          England, and removed them to Taunton to build a ship of 140 
          tonns (the first ship or vessel that ever had been built on that 
          river) and had all the ironwork or much the greater part thereof 
          used in building her made out of the iron oar of that place and 
          wrought into bolts and spikes and nailes etc., by an engenious 
          fellow named Robert Grossman born at that place, and was 
          since the Representative for the same many years in the General 
          Assembly of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts</placeName>. I built several more and larger 
          ships there soon after, and there has been built since above 500 
          ships on the same river, and I doubt not but with the ironworke 
          for them, the natural produce of the same place wch. also

          89. i. Answers of the Lt. Governor of Pensylvania to the

          and the <placeName ref="#us_de" role="direct">Three Lower Counties</placeName>, 
          (ii) The boundaries are nowhere fixed but on the East by the

          the North there has never yet been any occasion to

          <placeName ref="#us_ny_iroquoia" role="indirect">settlements of the Five Nations</placeName> now supposed by the 
          Government of <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="indirect">New York</placeName> to belong to that Province. 
          Nor have any attempts been made to measure off the 
          five degrees of longitude (which is the breadth of the 
          Province by the King's patent, and would make about 
          265 miles) to the westward, but by the exactest French 
          maps yet given us, particularly De L'Isle's, the North- 
          west corner by these degrees of longitude and latitude 
          will fall on <placeName ref="#lk_great" role="boundary">their Lakes</placeName> etc. The French in their said 
          maps extend their <placeName ref="#us_la" role="indirect">Louisiana</placeName> as far East as the
          <placeName ref="#rv_susquehanna" role="boundary">River Susquehannah</placeName> which runs into the head of
          <placeName ref="#by_chesapeake" role="boundary">Chesapeak</placeName>, by which the Eastern and Western shores 
          (as they are commonly called) both of <placeName ref="#us_md" role="indirect">Maryland</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#us_va" role="indirect">Virginia</placeName> are 
          divided, and therefore they leave to Pensylvania a 
          breadth only of about 60 Eng. miles. It is also 
          remarkable that the Editors of a volume of Geography 
          published in a very large folio anno 1721 by subscrip- 
          tion from many of the Nobility and great Officers of 
          Britain as well as others called A New General Atlas, 
          the maps in which are engraved or revised by Senex, 
          have, to the scandal of the Nation, unadvisedly inserted 
          into it that Map of Louisiana as a proper description 
          of that country, without any alteration or restriction, 
          by which, as far as the authority of that book can 
          contribute, they give up to the French all their 
          exorbitant claims to the greater part of these British 
          Dominions, which whether it may deserve the notice 
          of your Honourable Board is humbly submitted, but 
          it cannot but give those who have considered the 
          mistake and have any concern for the honour and 
          interest of the Crown of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>
          a very just resentment. The boundary of Pensylvania to the 
          Southward is a circle about Newcastle at 12 miles 
          distance so farr as that reaches, and from thence a 
          line running directly west is to divide it from Maryland. 
          This line in the Royal grants for both Provinces is 
          called the fortieth degree of Northern Latitude, which 
          occasions a very high dispute, for it is most evident 
          by both patents, that at the respective times of the 
          grants, it was not conceived, that what is commonly 
          understood by the 40th degree of latitude would 
          extend near so far northward on the land, as it is now 
          found from later observations by more exact land 
          instruments. Maryland in the patent to Lord 
          Baltemore seems positively limited to <placeName ref="#rv_delaware" role="boundary">Delaware Bay</placeName>
          which ends somewhat to the southward of Newcastle 
          etc. The whole tenour of that grant appears to bound 
          it by the heads of the Bay of Delaware and Chesapeak. 
          It can also be clearly proved, that the first grantee of 
          Maryland understood his province to be bounded by 
          the head of Chesapeak Bay, and about 1683 not much 
          above one year after Mr. Penn first arrived here with 
          his people to settle his Colony, the then Lord Baltemore 
          being himself in these parts thought fitt to run a line 
          a few miles above the head of the said Bay, to which 
          line he formally made his claim, and to that boundary 
          as allow'd on the part of Maryland this Province has 
          ever since extended its settlements, and great numbers 
          of families near 50 years since sate down and laid out 
          their substance in improving the said lands, and raising 
          estates, which have descended to their children etc. 
          Yet now from the later discoveries that have been 
          made of the latitude, Maryland would extend their 
          countrey much higher and take to themselves a con- 
          siderable part of those estates : But our inhabitants 
          have hitherto held their possessions. The claim 
          nevertheless on the part of Maryland still subsisting 
          occasions great uneasiness amongst the people. And 
          tho' the respective Governors, who live in a good 
          understanding with each other, have hitherto shewn, 
          and still continue to use, such moderation and caution 
          on both sides, as that no violences, by the countenance 
          of either Government, have been committed, yet it is 
          of vast importance to the publick peace and security 
          of H.M. good subjects, as well as for the interest of the 
          Proprietors, that this dispute should with as little 
          delay as possible be effectually ended, (iii) Describes 
          Constitution and Courts, (iv) The shipping annually 
          cleared from <placeName ref="#us_pa_philadelphia" role="direct">Philadelphia</placeName>,

          three ports of trade within this Government, are 
          computed to be about 170, and as they consist chiefly 
          of sloops and small briganteens they cannot be reckoned 
          one with another to exceed 60 tons with a complement 
          of 7 men to each vessel etc. For these last ten years 
          the shipping are encreased one full third, (v) As this 
          with all other of the American Provinces are limited 
          to trade only with Britain, and H.M. Colonies, and no 
          goods from Britain pay any duties, there is therefore 
          no occasion to have any such entries made as can 
          enable us to render an exact account of the quantities, 
          but the sorts are generally such dry goods as are con- 
          sumed in Great Britain vizt. woollens, linens, silks, 
          habedashry etc. necessary for apparell, ironware 
          and other necessaries for husbandry building and 
          furniture of houses, (vi) There is no considerable 
          trade between this Government and any foreign 
          Plantations ; what there is, is chiefly with the Dutch 
          vizt. three or four small vessells in a year to <placeName ref="#gr" role="indirect">Surinam</placeName>, 
          perhaps one to <placeName ref="#curacao" role="indirect">Curaçoa</placeName>, and sometimes one to
          <placeName ref="#steustatius" role="indirect">St. Eustacia</placeName>, but none to any French or Spanish
          Plantations. Our exports thither are bread, flour, staves, 
          butter and some horses, and our returns are chiefly 
          melasses, some little rum and sugar. Our trade to 
          <placeName ref="#europe" role="indirect">Europe</placeName> is but casual, and according as there is demand 
          for grain, in which case, as in the late scarcity of wheat 
          in Europe about 40,000 bushels were shipt from hence to
          <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName>, <placeName ref="#pt_lisbon" role="indirect">Lisbon</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">the Streights</placeName>, but when there 
          are plentifull crops we ship little or none. To <placeName ref="#madeira" role="indirect">Madeira</placeName>
          there is shipt annually between 15 and 20,000 bushels 
          of wheat, some Indian corn and bread, in return for 
          which we have their wines. We now also sometimes 
          import salt from <placeName ref="#pt" role="indirect">Portugal</placeName>
          or <placeName ref="#es" role="indirect">Spain</placeName>, tho' rarely, most 
          of it being brought from the <placeName ref="#indies" role="indirect">West Indies</placeName>,
          (vii) At Philadelphia there are a Naval Officer, a Collector and 
          Comptroller, at Newcastle and Lewes a Naval Officer 
          and Collector each, who guard the trade, and all proper 
          care is taken to prevent any illegal practices therein, 
          so that notwithstanding the vigilancy of the Officers, 
          there are but very few forfeitures on that score, (viii) 
          The produce of this country and stapl: commodities 
          are wheat and Indian corn for exportation, rye, barley, 
          oats and buckwheat enough for home consumption, 
          but very little exported. Wheat manufactured into 
          flour and bread, barrell'd beef and pork in a reasonable 
          proportion to suit the cargoes of bread and flour for 
          the West Indies, hogshead and barrell staves in great 
          quantities are shipt off annually to the West Indies, 
          Madeira, Lisbon etc. ; skins and furrs (which are pur- 
          chased of the Indians in exchange of woollens, linens, 
          shott cutlery etc. all from Britain) with some pigg 
          iron annually are shipt off for Great Britain, also ships 
          built here make a considerable return, and our exports 
          in the whole may be computed at about 70,000£., or 
          80,000£. sterl., but make less or more according to the 
          markets they meet with. In return to our exports to 
          the W. Indies we have litle else than rum in but too 
          large quantities, with melasses and sugar which are 
          consumed in the country. Divers undertakers here, in 
          hopes of making large returns by iron, have to theire 
          very great cost erected furnaces, but the low price of 
          pigg iron in Britain for these two years past has proved 
          a very great discouragement and disappointment, so 
          that some of these furnaces are like to fall. Great 
          endeavours have also been used, with a bounty from 
          the Government, to promote the raising of hemp, in 
          expectation of making a return by it to Britain, but 
          very litle as yet has been exported. We have also 
          hopes that the raising of silk, which has been tried 
          with some success, may in time be pursued by the 
          inhabitants, our climate and soil very well agreeing 
          with the silkworm, and mulberry tree, (ix) We know 
          of no mines as yet but iron, and some litle copper, of 
          which last in this Province no discoveries have as yet 
          been made that countervail the trouble and charge. 
          (x) This Government has not hitherto had occasion to 
          use any method that can furnish us with an exact 
          estimate, but as near as can at present be guessed there 
          may be about 45,000 souls of whites and 4000 blacks, 
          (xi) The inhabitants have been exceedingly encreased 
          within these last ten years by means of their continued 
          resort hither from Great Britain, Ireland, <placeName ref="#de" role="indirect">Germany</placeName>
          etc. from which two last we have of late had great 
          numbers, and 'tis beleived within these ten years the 
          inhabitants have encreased above one half of what 
          they were before (xii, xiii). This being an inland 
          Province no forts have been built, nor is there any 
          formed Militia in it. (xiv) The number of Indians 
          inhabiting this Province is very much decreased, and 
          those which remain scarce exceed 600 men, excluding 
          the five Nations etc., and at the first settlement of this 
          Colony such measures were taken with them by Mr. 
          Penn, which are still carefully continued, that they 
          have lived in perfect peace with the inhabitants, and 
          they are very well affected to the British interest, 
          (xv) As to the strength of the neighbouring Indians, 
          encloses a paper drawn up in 1718 by Mr. Logan, a 
          gentleman of good literature and large experience, 
          who having been himself engaged in the Indian trade, 
          from the informations he collected from some who 
          had long and often travelled through <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName>, and the 
          country about <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="indirect">Missassippi</placeName>, drew up at the request of 
          Sir Wm. Keith then Governor of this Province an 
          account of the French trade, their routes and their 
          Indians, etc., to be transmitted to your Board in answer 
          to some queries then sent him. How Sir William 
          might transmitt it I know not, but as it appears to me 
          curious and valueable, with that gentleman's leave, 
          who has lent me his original draught, I here give you 
          an exact copy etc. (xvi, xvii). All claims of the 
          Spaniards lye so remote, that no occasion has been 
          given us to have any knowledge of, or concern about, 
          them. The French of Canada are much nearer neigh- 
          bours, but fall principally under the notice of H.M. 
          Government of New York, from whence undoubtedly 
          the best informations may be had : yet Mr. Logan's 
          paper may give your Lops, considerable information, 
          (xviii) Revenue : By the emission of a paper currency, 
          an annual interest arises thereon amounting to near 
          3000£. this currency, which with a small excise on 
          spirits not amounting to 1000£. yearly raise together 
          a sufficiency to answer all the present exigencies of 
          this Government, (xix) By order of the Assemblies 
          annually there is generally paid to the Governor about 
          1200£. pr. annum besides perquisites ; some further 
          allowances are likewise made to the Provincial Judges, 
          Treasurer, Attorney General and Trustees of the Loan 
          Office, the bounties also and charge of Indian Treaties 
          take a part but generally at the end of the year the 
          accounts are near a balance, (xx) There are no 
          establishments here, for there being no Militia, there 
          is consequently no military one, and the Officers of the 
          Government have either such annual allowances made 
          to them as the Assemblies think proper, or the fees of 
          their offices as established by our laws, and generally 
          they hold their places by commission from the 
          Proprietor or his Lieutenant during pleasure. Signed,

        <p>Paper drawn up by Mr. Logan in 1718, referred to 
          in preceding. The memorial of which the Lords 
          Commissioners have transmitted a copy etc. appears 
          well-grounded. 'Tis well known that ever since the 
          expedition of the Sieur La Salle, the French have 
          claimed all the lands to the northward and westward 
          of the British Colonies, from <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName> along the Lakes 
          and <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="indirect">Messassippi River</placeName>, in which they further strengthen 
          themselves, by alledging, that the Article in the Treaty 
          of Reswick, by which all lands or rivers in America 
          of the mouth of which either nation were then possessed 
          are conceded to that nation as high as the first sources 
          of those rivers, is a full cession of all that tract of land 
          to the French : tho' it cannot be probable that it was 
          ever so intended, because 'tis not only inconsistent 
          with the ancienter grant from the Crown to the Proprietors
          of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName>, but with the security of all the 
          British Colonies on this <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">Continent of America</placeName>. From 
          the time of their first discoveries of Missassippi they 
          have with great care settled a communication between 
          Canada and the <placeName ref="#us_la" role="indirect">Southern countries</placeName> on that river, for 
          which they have three different routes all of which are 
          the same as far as <placeName ref="#lk_erie" role="indirect">Lake Erie</placeName>.
          They sail in canoes from <placeName ref="#ca_qc_montreal" role="indirect">Montreal</placeName>
          abt. 3 leagues to the <placeName ref="#lachine" role="indirect">fall of St. Louis</placeName>, where 
          they have a portage or carrying place by land of about 
          half a league, then they reimbarque row up the stream 
          about 60 leagues to <placeName ref="#ca_on_frontenac" role="indirect">fort Frontenac</placeName> on the north side, 
          and at the beginning of <placeName ref="#lk_ontario" role="indirect">Lake Ontario</placeName>; In this fort is 
          a small garrison consisting of one or two companies in 
          the King's pay, from thence they proceed on the Lake 
          Ontario generally reputed to be 80 leagues in length 
          to those dreadfull <placeName ref="#niagara_falls" role="indirect">Falls of Niagara</placeName>, which oblige them 
          to land, the portage is about three leagues, after 
          reimbarquing, they goe up the <placeName ref="#rv_niagara" role="indirect">Strait</placeName> about 6 leagues, 
          after which they enter Lake Erie which they call 130 
          leagues in length. The shortest passage from hence 
          to Missassippi by water is to goe up
          <placeName ref="#rv_maumee" role="indirect">the river of the Miamies or Oumamies</placeName>
          that enters Lake Erie on the 
          Southwest about 150 leagues, they then come to 
          another carrying place of about 3 leagues, where the 
          highest land is, and from hence the waters divide their 
          descent between Missassippi and that lake, there they 
          imbarque on a small shallow river called La Riviere 
          de Portage, down which they row 40 leagues, to the 
          <placeName ref="#rv_wabash" role="indirect">River Wabash or Ouabache</placeName>, and on that river 
          according to the traders reckoning 120 leagues to the
          <placeName ref="#rv_ohio" role="indirect">river Ohio</placeName>, into which the other falls, then 80 leagues down 
          Ohio to Missassippi and thence 350 leagues to the
          <placeName ref="#gf_mexico" role="indirect">Bay of Mexico</placeName>. Some call both these rivers by the same 
          name, and generally Wabache, but they ought to be 
          distinguished, because the head of Ohio comes much 
          more easterly, extending even to the Government of <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="indirect">New York</placeName>
          towards <placeName ref="#us_va" role="indirect">Virginia</placeName> or Carolina, and among 
          divers other large streams it receives the <placeName ref="#rv_tennessee" role="indirect">River Peresippi</placeName>
          on the south side, not far from the mouth 
          of Wabache, which river of Perisippi is said to rise in 
          the mountains of Virginia and Carolina. The other 
          two passages are both prick'd down in Hennepin's 
          map, according to the accounts given are thus. From 
          the North-west of Lake Erie they sail 8 leagues to a 
          fort on <placeName ref="#lk_stclair" role="indirect">Lake St. Claire</placeName> called Erie
          <placeName ref="#us_mi_fortdetroit" role="indirect">Pont Chartrain</placeName>
          where there is a settlement of the French, and often 
          400 traders meet here, then along the Lake 7 leagues, 
          thence to the great <placeName ref="#lk_huron" role="indirect">Lake Huron</placeName> about 10 leagues, 
          on this lake they proceed to the <placeName ref="#mackinac">Straits of Missilimakina</placeName> 
          120 leagues, here is a Garrison of about 30 French, 
          and a vast concourse of traders, sometimes not less 
          than a thousand besides Indians, being a common 
          place of rendezvous. At or near this place are the 
          Outawas settled. From Lake Huron they pass by 
          the strait Misilimakina 4 leagues being 2 in breadth, 
          and of a great depth to the <placeName ref="#lk_michigan" role="indirect">Lake Illinois</placeName>, thence 150 
          leagues on the Lake to Fort Miami situate on the 
          mouth of the <placeName ref="#rv_chicago" role="indirect">River Chigagow</placeName>. This fort is not 
          regularly garrison'd, from hence came those Indians 
          of the same name vizt. Miamies, who are settled on 
          the aforementioned river that runs into Erie. Up 
          the River Chigagow they sail but 3 leagues to a portage 
          of a quarter of a league, then they enter a small Lake 
          of about a mile, and have another very small portage, 
          and again another of 2 miles to the <placeName ref="#rv_illinois" role="indirect">River Illinois</placeName>, 
          thence down the same 130 leagues to Missasippi. The third is from 
          Misilimakina on Lake Illinois to the <placeName ref="#by_green" role="indirect">Lake des Puans</placeName>
          90 leagues, thence to the <placeName ref="#rv_fox" role="indirect">River Puans</placeName> 80 
          leagues, thence up the same to a portage of about 4 
          miles over to the <placeName ref="#rv_wisconsin" role="indirect">River Ouisconsing</placeName>, thence 40 leagues 
          to Missassippi. From the mouth of Ouisconsing to 
          the mouth of the River Illinois is reputed about 150 
          leagues on Missasippi, and from thence to the mouth 
          of Ohio 70 leagues etc. These distances are as the 
          traders reckon them, but they appear to be generally 
          overdone, which may be owing to those people's 
          coasting along the shores of the Lakes, and taking in 
          all the windings of the rivers. The French use their 
          utmost endeavours to bring over all the Indians into 
          their interest, the Iroquese or five Nations have stood 
          chiefly in their way, but by their Jesuites and other 
          means they daily debauch them from the English. 
          The number of the whole is not now above 2000 fighting 
          men, of which the French have drawn over 700 to 
          inhabit amongst themselves, vizt. 400 seated at the 
          Fall of St. Louis on the south side of <placeName ref="#rv_stlawrence" role="indirect">St. Laurence</placeName> and 
          300 on the north side, the rest of them are planted 
          chiefly along the Lake Ontario at some distance from 
          it. There are no Indians in the French interest on 
          this side of St. Laurence nearer than the Miamies or 
          Twechtwese as the Iroquese call them who are about 
          2000 seated chiefly on the aforementioned river 
          Miamis flowing into Lake Erie and on or near the 
          branches of Oubache. The Illinois are about 3,000 men 
          on and near the river of that name. The Misilimakinaes 
          or Outtawas were formerly 3000 but now are scarce 500. 
          The Nokes 100, the Fellesavoins 200, the Sakes 200, the 
          Puans 600. All these joyned with the French against 
          the Iroquese, and all of them except the Mimaies are
          seated about or near to the Lake Illinois, which is now 
          commonly call'd by them Mechegan, and on the rivers 
          that run into it, and on Lake Puans and the River 
          Illinois. There are also divers other nations between 
          Mechegan and Missasippi, as the Renards or Foxes, 
          Massekobins, Kikapous, but these being further off, 
          did not joyn the French against the Iroquese. On 
          Missasippi and the branches of it there are many great 
          Nations, especially to the West as the Missouris, 
          Ozages, Acansias, who are different from those of 
          Acansa on the East, with many more, not less as is 
          affirmed, than 60,000 men, with all of whom the French 
          have peace and some alliance. On the other hand all 
          the English to the northward of Carolina have not 
          1500 men in their interest excepting the Iroquese. In 
          <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="secondary">New England</placeName> and
          <placeName ref="#us_ct" role="secondary">Connecticut</placeName> they have very few. In
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="secondary">New York</placeName> they have only the River Indians besides 
          the Iroquese. In <placeName ref="#us_nj" role="secondary">Jersey</placeName> and
          <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="secondary">Pensylvania</placeName> their own 
          or home Indians called Delawares are exceedingly 
          decreased, and being in subjection to the Iroquese 
          take their rules from them. In <placeName ref="#us_md" role="secondary">Maryland</placeName> and Virginia 
          there are very few, excepting those whom Colonel 
          Spottswood with great industry has lately established 
          there. Those of Carolina and the nations lately in 
          friendship have been very numerous. But the 
          Iroquese, whether prompted by the French, or 
          from what other cause is not yet known, have of 
          late years made great inroads upon them, and cannot 
          as yet by any endeavours of the English be diverted 
          from it. But of all these people the best accounts will 
          naturally come from Carolina.           
          The methods that may be proposed to prevent the 
          designs of the French seem to be these, (i) To use all 
          reasonable endeavours to preserve the Iroquese, tho' 
          the English of Virginia and Carolina are very much 
          incensed against them, and the French endeavour to 
          animate all the other English to the northward in the 
          same manner, as being a bloody, barbarous and 
          imperious people, at the same time that they them- 
          selves cajole them, and endeavour by all means to 
          make them their own. Yet their preservation seems 
          to be of vast importance to us. (ii) To encourage the 
          Government of Virginia to extend their settlements 
          beyond <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="direct">the mountains</placeName>, over which the present 
          Governour has happily discovered passes, and to build 
          some forts on Lake Erie with the concurrence of the 
          Iroquese settled not far from thence : Colonel Spottiswood
          had this in view, till discouraged by the repeal 
          of their act for the Indian trade, the consequence of 
          which act 'tis doubted was not clearly enough understood, 
          (iii) To encourage and support the trade of 
          South Carolina who have very good opportunities of 
          making alliances with all the Indians to the southward 
          of the Lakes, and to the east of Missasippi. To which 
          their grant from the Crown gives them a very good 
          claim, (iv) To give such orders and instructions to 
          the Governours that they take special care of the 
          commerce with the Indians, that while they endeavour 
          to promote the trade of their own people, they shall 
          do nothing to weaken the interest of other Colonies 
          to which traders are too subject ; gain being their 
          only view. By these means all the Indians, with 
          whom we have any commerce, may be very much 
          united to the British interest, for the Indians being 
          supplied generally with better goods (excepting fire 
          arms, powder and some trinketts) and at easier rates 
          by the English than the French, they will choose to 
          deal with us rather than with them, and their interest 
          in this is commonly the strongest tie upon them. 
          The French indeed seem to exceed us in industry, and 
          in accommodating themselves to the humours of those 
          barbarous people, and they have now a vast number 
          of bold expert traders whom they call coureurs de bois, 
          who generally are as capable of the fatigues of long 
          journeys and fighting by ambush in the woods, the

          have made other improvements in this land, had the light of 
          your Majesty's countenance shone upon us. For there is a 
          great part of this land by industry might be cultivated and

          Governor Hunter to the [? Duke of Newcastle]. Since 
          my last, a copie of which is inclos'd, the several companys of 
          two regiments have been sent to their respve. quarters where 
          it was judg'd they might be of most use, and barracks built, 
          where there are not finisht they are quarter'd by the parish'oners. 
          The private men are generally in good health and condition, 
          but of the officers, Major Brandreth, and Captn. Moloy of Coll. 
          Hayes, and Capt. Ballenden and Lieut. Sutton of Coll. Cope's 
          regiment are dead. That the service may not suffer, upon 
          application from the commanding officers, etc., I have order 'd 
          out commissions etc., detailed. Continues : The officers are 
          preferr'd according to their seniority and service, and I hope 
          H.M. will confirm their commissions. There are absent three 
          Captains and 7 subalterns. Our countrey party, consisting of 
          about 180 men were march'd from their place of rendezvous 
          before the regiments arriv'd. They had the luck to surprize 
          <placeName ref="#jm_nannytown" role="direct">the chiefe negro setlement</placeName>
          in the neighbourhood of <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName> 
          gott into the town with the loss of two men and a few wounded 
          the negro's set fire to that part of their town next to the 
          mountains and fled thither under the cover of the smoak. Our 
          party did not pursue but kept in the town three days and on 
          the fourth burnt it consisting of a hundred and six houses, and 
          retir'd to Port Antonio : I have order'd them immediately back 
          thither, if the officer finds them in good heart and willing, if 
          otherwise, to disband them : for they left it contrary to my 
          orders and have not taken one pris'ner. By the advice of the 
          Council and at the desire of the most substantial merchts. and 
          inhabitants, I have dissolv'd the Genll. Assembly, issu'd writts 
          for calling a new one, and our elections begin to-morrow. If 
          the gentlemen who desir'd the dissolution will exert themselves 
          we may hope for a better, but it can not well be worse : men of 
          desperate fortunes who want protection, and some of desperate 
          principles who want confusion will ever be the most active 
          and industrious to gett in but I hope the people's eyes 
          are opened etc. Will write by Capt. Dent, who is to depart

          to the King. There is a certain tract of land in 
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="direct">New York</placeName> containing 62,000 acres, commonly called the
          <placeName ref="#us_ny_putnam" role="direct">'Equivalent land'</placeName> because the same was formerly 
          taken from the <placeName ref="#us_ct" role="direct">Colony of Connecticut</placeName>, in lieu of the 
          like quantity yielded to that Colony by the Province 
          of New York upon the settling of their respective 
          boundarys, which tract of land is scituate between the 
          antient easterly bounds of New York upon the main 
          land, and the present westerly bounds of Connecticut, 
          bounded towards the north by the south line of the

          miles distance from <placeName ref="#rv_hudson" role="boundary">Hudsons River</placeName> etc. The said 
          tract hath never yet been granted to any person by 
          the Crown, but if the same were duly settled and 
          improved under a grant thereof from your Majesty, 
          it might be rendered greatly advantagious to this 
          Kingdom in the production of hemp, pitch, tarr, and 
          other kinds of naval stores, and is well scituated for 
          cultivating a furr trade with the Indian Nations in 
          that neighbourhood. Propose to settle it with 100 
          persons within 7 years and more as they find encouragement,
          and to pay 2s. 6d. per 100 acres, the same quit-
          rent as is reserved in all grants of lands in New York.

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. As I conceive no words can represent 
          the state of <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">this Island</placeName>, and 
          the conduct of the present General Assembly so clearly, and 
          justly, as their own votes, I have the honour of transmitting 
          them herewith to your Grace, from the first meeting of the 
          present General Assembly, to the 19th instant inclusive : this 
          last day of their meeting they passed a petition to H.M. upon 
          the subject matter of the report of the Committee appointed 
          to prepare a representation of their grievances, which report 
          is set down at large in their foregoing Minutes of the 15th of the 
          last month, but as to their petition I have not seen a copy of it. 
          The report setts forth the former petition made to H.M. against 
          me by the Assembly in 1728, which they now repeat again under
          pretence that they did not know that that petition had been 
          preferred to H.M., but they are informed, that it was transmitted to
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> in order to be preferred, but miscarryed for 
          want of proper Agents to sollicite the same. I was very much 
          surprised on reading these votes for I thought, it was notoriously 
          known, that it was not only preferr'd, but was order'd by H.M. 
          to be heard by the Lords for Trade etc. together with my answer, 
          and accordingly was heard, and the petition dismissed : but I 
          suppose this repetition of what they could not prove is to be 
          imposed upon the world, as an undoubted proof of the truth of 
          it. I can't help being amazed at their bold assertion in relation 
          to the conduct of the Gentlemen of H.M. Council here, who, 
          they say, " far from making the laws of the land, and the good 
          of their country the rule of their conduct, have acted of late, 
          as if they looked upon themselves indispensibly obliged to 
          concurr with H.E., in every attempt of his upon our liberties, 
          and properties ; " and in their foregoing votes of the 15th 
          of January last, they treat them as incendiaries. But whoever 
          considers the conduct of the Assembly for these three last years 
          in relation to the tax granted to H.M. for supporting the honour 
          and dignity of the Government, as well as by their own votes 
          would be apt to think that they accused the Council of what 
          they were guilty themselves. In their address to me they say 
          that if any deficiencies have happen'd in the collecting the tax, 
          the same " have proceeded from the miserable poverty of the 
          people, who thereby are forced to defend themselves against 
          the rigorous prosecutions, they are daily threatened with " etc. 
          (v. C.S.P. 27th Nov., 1730), and perhaps they may construe 
          any prosecution upon this head, as attempts upon their libertys, 
          and properties ; so that had H.M. Attorney General here prose- 
          cuted every one for H.M. tax who had not paid nor had given 
          in the number of his negro's to his representative or who had 
          not been returned by him a defaulter (for against these the 
          Treasurer by the law is not impower'd to issue his warrant 
          within four months after the time of payment, nor are these 
          persons after the said time discharged of the duty, but only 
          those against whom the law empowers the Treasurer to issue 
          his warrants, which has already been represented to H.M. in 
          the address of the Council) they might have called it a rigorous 
          prosecution, which would be a very absurd construction of the 
          law, as if any one's neglect, or refusal to deliver in the list of his 
          negro's as by the law he is obliged cou'd exempt him from the 
          duty, upon the whole I am most humbly of opinion that if an 
          order was sent to H.M. Attorney General here to sue every body 
          who had not paid their tax for these two last years, and against 
          whom the Treasurer is not empower'd by the law to issue his 
          warrants for the same, after a convenient limited time was 
          allowed them for the payment thereof, I am satisfied the country 
          would be soon quiet, for the people are daily expecting it, and
          say if this be the King's tax, and we ought to pay, how comes 
          it that there is not an order to oblige us to pay. In my letter 
          of 16th Jan. etc., I mentioned an expedient I could have wished 
          the Assembly would have come into, not that H.M. tax could 
          not have been recover'd by due course of law, but out of 
          tenderness to the inhabitants of this Island, for if H.M. Attorney 
          General here was to sue in the Exchequer every body that had 
          not paid his tax the expense of such a prosecution would fall 
          heavy especially on the poor people. Another insinuation in 
          the report is, that Mr. Webster holds the office of Secretary under 
          Francis Whitworth Esq. in trust for me, and therefore I had 
          recommended to the Assembly the fragment of what was due 
          to him, your Grace knows that what I did upon this head was 
          in obedience to H.M. orders in Council, not only for what was 
          due to my Lord Micklethwait and Mr. Whitworth, which was 
          from April 1714 to 1st March, 1726, but also for the future for 
          what ever shall become due to the Secretary for such services 
          as shall be performed by him for the publick. But your Grace 
          will observe by their votes of 19th instant how differently they 
          act in favour of their own officers, they there pass a petition to 
          me unanimously for the payment of 242£. 6s. 7d. for their Clerke, 
          tho' by their Minutes of the 4th Nov., 1729, his salary is settled 
          for the said year at 150£. and 50£. for publishing the votes in 
          the four towns of this Island. By the same annual proportion 
          there should be due to the Clerks of the Council from March, 
          1714 to 26th March, 1729, 3878£. Os. 4d., tho' their accounts 
          come to but 2823£. 16s. 9d. besides 300£., which was paid to Mr. 
          Lenoir a former Deputy Secretary, which would make the whole 
          sum 3123£. 16s. 9d. The report further sets forth, that of all 
          their grievances, that of the encrease of the French trade and 
          power is the greatest, and that it will be proper forthwith to 
          prepare an humble address to his most Gracious Majesty for 
          redress therein, and that accordingly a petition had been 
          presented, but, they say, they know too, that that petition had 
          been opposed at the Board of Trade by me and that my Agent 
          Mr. Sharpe was now opposeing the same ; what I have wrote 
          I thought it was my duty to do, I stated the facts truly, and 
          because Mr. Sharpe transacts my affairs in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>,
          is he to act for nobody else that will employ him ? And as it is notoriously           
          known that he is employed by one of the <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">Northern Colonys</placeName>, 
          a jealous mind might imagine, that this is mentioned to make 
          me odious to the inhabitants. As the Assembly, and they who 
          oppose the payment of H.M. tax have entertained of late great 
          hopes of Mr. Othniel Haggats being a Counsellor, tho' I could 
          say much upon that head, I need only refer your Grace to their 
          own votes by which your Grace will see the part that Gentleman 
          has acted. I dont know any two Gentlemen in the Island, that 
          have been more zealous against the payment of the King's tax, 
          than Mr. Ashley, and he etc. The Guarda da Costa of <placeName ref="#mq" role="direct">Martinico</placeName>
          about a month since went into <placeName ref="#lc_carenage" role="direct">the Carnache</placeName>, a port in
          <placeName ref="#lc" role="indirect">Sta. Lucia</placeName>, where vessells generally resort to carry on a clandestine 
          trade with the French inhabitants of Martinico, and meeting 
          with a great many English vessells, he seized them all, as soon 
          as I was informed of it, I wrote to the Governor of Martinico, 
          that he would restore them, but I have not yet his answer ; 
          however there is a report, that they were condemn'd in the 
          Admiralty Court there, from whence they had appealed to the 
          Governour and Council. I must observe upon this head that 
          some time before this accident happen'd a French Guarda da 
          Costa went in there, and one of the English vessells that were 
          there, fired at her, and lodged a shot in her bow, upon which 
          he return'd to Martinico to make his complaint, and the next 
          day a French man of war was sent thither, but not finding the 
          vessell, which had fired at the Guarda da Costa, he returned 
          without injuring any that were there etc. Encloses duplicate

        <p>Mr. Fane to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          In reply to Queries of Jan. 12th, is of opinion (i) that the powers 
          given to the Fishing Admirals and the civil magistrates are 
          entirely distinct ; The Fishing Admirals have no powers but what 
          arise from the Act of the 10th and 11th of K. William III and 
          those confined to the fishing, and the Justices can no more 
          interfere with them in regard to such powers, than the fishing 
          Admirals can interfere with the Justices in the powers given 
          them by their commission, (ii) That the former have no power 
          to send warrants to the constables or commit to prison or the 
          stocks. They are indeed by said Act directed to see that law 
          put in execution, but there is no power to be given by that law 
          to levy penalties or inflict punishments. The want of it, is 
          certainly a defect etc. Thinks the Fishing Admirals are sub- 
          ordinate to the Justices in everything but what relates to their 
          fishing authority, (iii) " I apprehend that aU the statute laws 
          made here previous to H.M. subjects settling in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName> 
          are in force there : it being a settlement in an infidel country : 
          and as to the laws passed here subsequent to the settlement, 
          I take it they will not extend to this country unless it is particu- 
          larly mentioned, (iv) I do not think the Governour himself 
          can act as Justice of the Peace, for I observe the power from His 
          Majestic is only to appoint fit persons for the administration 
          of Justice." Signed, Fran. Fane. Endorsed, Reed. 30th March,

        <p>Petition of Jacob Stauber, John Ocks, Ezekiel Harlan and Thomas Gould 
          to the Council of Trade and Plantations. Stauber and Harlan have lived 
          upwards of 20 years in <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="direct">Pennsilvania</placeName>
          following husbandry of which they have a perfect understanding.
          Stauber lately took a journey into <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">[? Virgin]ia</placeName>
          on purpose to make a search after some uninhabited land behind 
          <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="direct">the mountains of that Province</placeName>, which are above 30 miles over,
          and but one place fit for a road. After he had passed these
          mountains with much pains, great difficulty and hazard of life,
          without any company or seeing any Indians in all his travels,
          he spent three months time to view the soyl and situation of
          the land lying westward to the said mountains towards
          <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="indirect">Missisipy river</placeName>, which land he found to be good pasture ground
          fitt for planting of vineyards on the side of the mountains, and 
          a very good soyle for hemp, flax, and all sorts of grain, a proper 
          climate [? to prod]uce silk and a good prospect to make salt 
          petre and potash. Your Lordships are doubtless fully perswaded
          that it will be a great importance to the Crown and 
          interest of the Nation that these Dominions may be enlarged 
          beyond the mountains to the West for the following considerations: 
          If it is neglected to extend the bounds of Great Britain 
          beyond the mountains to the west, it is probable that the French 
          in a short time may take possession thereof. In settling a 
          colony beyond these mountains extending as [? far] as the river 
          of Missisipy, the French settlements of Missisipy and <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName>
          would thereby be prevented to join together, as their intention 
          is, which will be of great prejudice to this Kingdom. The 
          strength of the subjects of this Kingdom in America would be 
          considerably encreased by carrying over a great number of 
          Germans and Swiss Protestants who will be chiefly such as can 
          provide for themselves at [? their own]n charge, which are also 
          reputed to be a good Militia. This colony would be obliged to 
          apply themselves chiefly by reason of the distant land carriage 
          upon such productions as are very much desired in this Kingdom, 
          vizt., hemp, flax, silk, potash, salt petre, with other valuable 
          commodities in which the Germans and Swissers are particularly 
          skilled in (except the silk), the expectation of which commodities 
          from other colonies [? has been] hitherto not answered, it would 
          also considerably augment our trade by consuming a good 
          quantity of the manufacture of this Kingdom, and employ 
          m[?uch ship]ping etc. Pray the Board to recommend the 
          Government to grant them a joint patent of a free grant of a 
          tract of land to begin at the <placeName ref="#mt_doubletop" role="direct">Double Top Mountain</placeName> by
          <placeName ref="#rv_hawksbill" role="direct">Hawks Bill Creek</placeName> including the mountains through which the road 
          is to be made, to go thence northwards in a line to the border 
          of Pensilvania and behind the same, to make the whole breadth 
          200 miles, thence in a straight line to the Missisipy etc. 
          Petitioners undertake the settlement of this colony without 
          any charge to the Government, which hitherto no person has 
          attempted to undertake etc. Will make a road 30 miles long 
          through the mountains, and for security against the Indians 
          will purchase the land and friendship of them with considerable 
          presents etc. " Being so far separated from Virginia, by the 
          mountains 'tis humbly desired that it may be a separate Colony 
          and Government under the [? na]me of Georgia. Stauber, who 
          has employed much time and expences in searching out this 
          land and making a voyage hither, prays for a speedy decision, 
          intending to go without delay to <placeName ref="#de" role="indirect">Germany</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#ch" role="indirect">Switzerland</placeName> to 
          get people to go with them to Virginia etc. Endorsed, Recd.,

          take bait or use any sort of trade or fishing whatsoever 
          in those parts ? (iv) Whether the said Inhabitants 
          are wholly supplied with sail cloth, nets and tackle for 
          their fishery, and with woollen, linnen, leather and 
          other manufactures, for their use ard wear, from
          <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">this Kingdom</placeName>?
          Or from the Plantations or any foreign 
          country ? (v) What wages do the inhabitants allow 
          to their servants for carrying on the Fishery ? And 
          in what manner do they pay them ? (vi) How much 
          the charge of fitting out and maintaining one of their 
          fishing boats, for the whole season amounts to ? (vii) 
          What number of inhabitants are settled near the coast 
          where the Fishery is carried on ? What share have 
          they in the Fishery ? And how they employ them- 
          selves during the remainder of the year ? (viii) 
          Whether the houses, buildings and inclosures of the 
          inhabitants are at such a distance from the water side 
          as not to hinder or obstruct the fishermen in making 
          their flakes, or in drying and curing their fish ? (ix) 
          How many flakes are allowed to each fishing boat and 
          of what length ? Whether they are extended in length 
          according to the custom used in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="secondary">Newfoundland</placeName>
          from the shore up into the land ? Or whether any of the 
          inhabitants or fishermen extend their flakes along 
          shore or possess a larger front to the water side according
          to the number of their boats than was formerly 
          allowed at Newfoundland in that case ? (x) Whether 
          the fishing ships that proceed directly from this 
          Kingdom to Nova Scotia are victualled here and 
          provided with all other necessaries of British product 
          and manufacture for the whole voyage ? Or whether 
          the masters of freighters do not furnish themselves 
          with provisions that are brought from the Plantations 
          or other parts to Nova Scotia ? (xi) Whether any of 
          the fishing ships pursue or follow the old laudable 
          custom of allowing their ships' company shares of 
          what they make in the voyage instead of wages, and 
          in such case how much doth the change of fitting out 
          and maintaining a ship of one hundred with fifty men 
          and ten boats amount to for the whole voyage ? (xii) 
          How many taverns or publick houses for entertainment 
          may there be kept in Nova Scotia or at least in the 
          harbour of Canso ? Are they kept only by the 
          inhabitants or by the people of <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="indirect">New England</placeName>? 
          Also do they trust the fishermen upon their own credit or 
          do the masters of the ships permit them to trust their 
          crews and deduct the same out of their respective 
          wages, hire or shares in order to satisfy the said tavern 
          keepers ? Are not the poor seamen hereby tempted 
          to spend the greatest part or the full amount of their 
          wages, and frequently run so far in debt, that they 
          are forced to remain as servants to the inhabitants, 
          and at last constrain'd to betake themselves to New 
          England ? (xiii) Whether the inhabitants do not 
          usually trust their own servants employ'd in the 
          Fishery with rum and other stores to a greater value 
          than their wages amount to ? And whether they are 
          not generally paid in the manner as in the foregoing 
          article ? (xiv) Whether the New England traders do 
          still continue to entice and carry thither numbers of 
          handicraft men, seamen and fishermen ? And whether 
          any of the inhabitants do favour or assist them therein. 
          Continues : And whereas H.M. Consuls and the merchants residing in 
          <placeName ref="#pt" role="secondary">Portugal</placeName>, <placeName ref="#es" role="secondary">Spain</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#it" role="secondary">Italy</placeName> unanimously complain,
          that by reason of the ill curing of fish for some years past the consumption thereof is 
          considerably lessen'd and that the trade will be lost 
          if effectual care be not taken to reform the same, you 
          are therefore to use your best endeavours that the 
          masters of the fishing ships and inhabitants do take 
          the greatest care in curing their fish with good salt, 
          and with a sufficient quantity and in preparing, 
          husbanding and ordering the same that the credit 
          thereof may be again recovered and esteemed in the 
          several places for which it is carried for sale. And 
          further upon this occasion you are very particularly 
          to inquire into their manner and method of taking 
          and curing their fish, what quantity of salt they allow 
          for curing 100 quintals ? Whether they are guilty 
          of any abuse in the ordering thereof ? Whether the 
          fish taken at a distance from the land by their small 
          vessels, is not prejudiced before it is brought on shore ? 
          Whether the inhabitants or the fishing ships are most 
          to be blamed ? And in short from whence these 
          complaints arise ? And what methods are to be taken 
          to prevent or rectify whatsoever is amiss ? You are 
          also to enquire into the present state of the French 
          Fishery at Canso and <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="direct">Cape Breton</placeName>, What number of 
          ships, boats and men they employ therein ? Whether 
          they do not encourage Irish Papists who are disaffected 
          to our present happy establishment and what number 
          of such may now be among the French. And to send 
          the best account you can of their strength number and 
          trade. You are farther to enquire whether any of the 
          Officers of the garrison at Canso are concerned directly 
          or indirectly by themselves or others in the Fishery ? 
          Or whether they take upon them to dispose of fishing 
          rooms, beaches, stages etc. to any person whatsoever 
          or hire out the soldiers to fish. Annexed,

          Governor Hunter to the Duke of Newcastle. Refers to letter of March 17. 
          Continues : The elections are not as yet over, but so far as they are gone 
          I think matters are mended. Capt. Dent who is to leave us in ten days will cary with him
          the acts pass'd last session, with the minutes and journals of 
          Council and Assembly. Last Supreme Court in Feb. one 
          William Wood was condemn'd to dye for the murder of Lodwick 
          Lardick. The Judges weighing the circumstances of the fact 
          have recommended him as an object of H.M. mercy. I beg

          comply with it. But the Adventure proving leaky Ld. 
          Muskery desir'd leave to putt the treasure on shoar to lighten 
          the ship, and it was accordingly lodg'd in the Custom-house, 
          and that the Govr. refus'd to restore it or suffer it to be 
          put again on board notwithstanding the protestations and 
          remonstrances of ye abovenamed gentlemen. Be this true 
          or false I had no share in the advice of sending it that or any

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Governor Johnson.
          We have received your letter of the 27th of December last,
          with the old broad Seal of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="direct">South Carolina</placeName>,
          and take this opportunity of congratulating you upon your safe arrival in 
          your Government, where we hope that by your prudent conduct 
          and behaviour, all those unhappy disputes and divisions which 
          have so much disturbed the publick tranquility of the Province, 
          may soon be settled. We are very glad that ye seven Cherrokee 
          Indian Chiefs are well satisfied with the treatment they receiv'd 
          whilst in <placeName ref="#en" role="direct">England</placeName>; as it will be the means of continuing a 
          lasting peace with the Indian nations bordering on your 
          Government. Mr. Lowndes, the Provost Marshal of your 
          Province, having again apply'd to us against ye act for the 
          better settling of the Courts of Justice in South Carolina, passed 
          there by Mr. Middleton in 1726, we take this opportunity of 
          mentioning to you our objections, that you may get another 
          act pass'd not lyable thereto. This Act alters the first process 
          in civil actions from a summons to a capias ; but as in our 
          Law-process, a summons is always suppos'd to be made in the 
          first instance, we think this part of the law ought to be amended 
          and a summons instituted instead of the capias, and the 
          rather, as it will be the least expensive way of proceeding and 
          ye most speedy to obtain justice By another clause in this 
          law we observe the Provost Marshal is obliged to give security 
          for the due performance of his Office ; but as the Provost 
          Marshal seldom resides in Carolina, we think it will be more 
          adviseable to oblige the Deputy to give security, or to mention 
          it in general terms that who ever shall personally execute that 
          office, shall be obliged to give security. As we have no objection 
          to the other parts of this Law, they may be re-enacted again, 
          but you must take care, to insert in the new law a clause to 
          suspend its taking effect till approved by H.M. We hope 
          shortly to receive some account of ye affairs under your 
          managemt. [C.O. 5, 401. pp. 17, 18.]</p>

          of the <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">Bahama Islands</placeName> thereto as soon as possible,

          to the queries of the Board of Trade, (i) Lond., 3rd April, 
          1731. The present Lessees have never granted any 
          lands nor given any authorities for granting of lands 
          but by letters, and they have never had any 
          information of any lands having been granted 
          pursuant to those letters, (ii) v. Sept. 9th. (iii) 
          They value their interest at 20,000£., having paid to 
          the old Lessees 20,000£. for the fortifications, and 
          other improvements made by them in, and they having 
          since expended in that work and in sending over 
          inhabitants, provisions and stores 20,000£. more and 
          upwards, and it is apprehended there are several 
          million of acres of land yet unsett. (iv) v. Sept. 9th. 
          (v) 700£. is due to the Lords Proprietors for arrears of 
          rent. N.B. The present Lessees have also expended 
          great sums in dislodging of pirates, defending the 
          islands from the Spaniards, of which accounts have 
          formerly been laid before the Lords Commissioners 
          for Trade, and the great importance these islands are 
          of to the Crown appears in several memorials presented

          Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and Plantations.
          Has taken all the care he could to prepare answers to queries. 
          Acknowledges letters of 1st Dec. and 12th Feb. last. 
          Refers to his letters of 7th Oct. and 10th Dec. etc.
          Continues : I am sorry I have occasion to say to your Lordships 
          this new Assembly have still gone backward, and seem resolv'd 
          to do nothing more [as to the Governor's salary] than they did 
          about forty years agoe when the form of government they are 
          now under was first erected, tho' I have left no stone unturn'd 
          to bring them to a sense of their duty. I can't help covering 
          to your Lordships what has been printed <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">here</placeName> out of the Decr. 
          Political State. Who was the vile authour I know not ; the 
          unreasonable ill nature at me is glaring, but I think there is a 
          strong implication of rudeness and ill manners to his most 
          Excellent Majesty and his Ministers, and it has been printed 
          here to poison H.M. subjects as much as possible and has 
          obtain'd the desir'd effect at present so far as to make this 
          Assembly (to use the authour's compliment upon them), more 
          obstinate in their refusal of complying with H.M. Instruction. 
          I think it's a pity but that the authour of the Political State 
          should be punisht according to his demerits. Notwithstanding 
          this villanous libel your Lordships will see by the Journals I 
          inclose (from the last sent you) my Speech to the Assembly, 
          and I still hope. Nothing shall make me swerve from my 
          royal Master's honour and interest. Your Lordships say you 
          should wait my next letters before you make yr. report to 
          H.M. upon this subject, which letters of mine I find were arriv'd 
          before the ships came away by which your Lordships wrote 
          me. I think it my duty to say to your Lordships that I have 
          at present no expectation of this Assembly's doing anything 
          in complyance with H.M. Instruction. They must rise in a 
          few days and I shall then transmit to your Lordships what 
          more may occur, and conformable to the Royal Charter, I shall 
          issue writs for a new Assembly 26 instant and keep your 
          Lordships duly acquainted with all my proceedings. Upon 
          my arrival I directed the King's Secretary to send your 
          Lordships under the seal of the Province at the end of every 
          session all the laws to which I gave my assent and this he tells 
          me he faithfully observes. In your Lordships' letter of 1 
          Deer, you seem to fault me that you had seen the printed 
          votes of the Assembly to that time from another hand, I must 
          ask pardon of your Lordships if I made any slip on this head. 
          I am sure it was not from any want of respect, but rather the 
          contrary, least I should trouble you with too many letters 
          onely to cover the House's Journals de die in diem : But I 
          thought if I sent them at the end of every session, they would 
          be more compleat, and more acceptable to yr. Lordships. Yet 
          if you would have me practice otherwise for the future I shall 
          (on your notice) duly observe it etc. Adds to denial of his 
          intending a military expedition against <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's Fort</placeName>
          the further confirmation that he did not keep or demolish it when 
          Hamilton, who called himself Col. Dunbar's Lieutenant, upon 
          sight of the King's Sheriffe (with his posse) deserted the fort, 
          and ran into the woods like a lusty fellow etc. Begs to be served 
          with a copy of any complaint before proceedings are taken 
          upon it etc. P.S. I should take it as a favour for the future, 
          that your Lordships would commit the care of your letters for 
          me to Francis Wilks Esq., they will always then come to me in 
          great safety. Signed, J. Belcher. Endorsed, Recd. 21st May,

        <p>Extract from the Political State of Great Britain for 
          the month of December, 1730. Abstract : The people 
          of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts Bay</placeName> continue in their refusal of 
          complying with H.M. Instructions for appointing a 
          fixed salary upon their Governors. Governor Belcher 
          insists as strongly as ever any Governor did upon 
          their complying, although he was formerly positive 
          against it and was the person sent over by them to 
          oppose any measures for such a settlement etc. Most 
          of the Council it seems think differently for the 
          Assembly. Quotes Governor's Speech to Council and 
          Assembly 2nd Oct., 1730 ; urging a settlement, 
          quoting the Board of Trade's report on the subject 
          in 1723, and reminding them that their disputes with 
          the Crown have already cost them over 50,000£. 
          From his experience as Agent assures them that 
          nothing prevented a Parliamentary proceeding against 
          them last winter, but the King being willing to give 
          them one more opportunity to show their duty and 
          gratitude by doing what is so just and reasonable. 
          Has the strongest persons to fear that they have " so 
          few friends among the King's Ministers, or in either 
          House of Parliament, as that a proceeding in a way 
          the King says, your final non-compliance must bring 
          it to, will bring into the utmost hazard every thing 
          that is dear to the people of this country " etc. Quotes 
          letters from Mr. Belcher and Mr. Wilks, Oct. 24, 1729 
          and 1st May, 1730, and Governor Belcher's Speech 
          to the Representatives, 16th Oct., 1730. The author 
          concludes : I am perswaded that these Gentlemen 
          of the House of Representatives, who are so resolute 
          against the commands of the Crown, have the honour 
          and interest of their native country, and the liberties 
          and properties of those they represent nearly at heart, 
          otherwise they would never make such a stand against 
          Royal Power, which has now so many ways of 
          rewarding its humble servants, and so large a scope 
          for punishing its opposers etc. The Assembly resembles 
          our Parliaments in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, the Governor represents 
          the King and the Council the Lords, and every member 
          of our Parliament would hear with disdain the threats 
          and expressions in Governor Belcher's Speech and 
          Message, " terms more proper for a French 
          Monarch, or a Turkish Bashaw than for an English 
          Governor " etc. As His Majesty "is so gracious, 
          that he ever desired to be independent of his 
          Parliament, I cannot think that he ever desired 
          that any of his Governors should be independent of 
          the people, they are sent to rule over. . . I am 
          perswaded that his Majesty has so great a regard for 
          the liberties of his people, that he will not give the least 
          handle for oppressing them in any part of his Dominions, 
          nor be disobliged by any man who delivers his 
          sentiments bravely and freely " etc. When any King 
          allows himself to be lulled asleep by putting a stop to 
          informations through the liberty of speech and the 
          Press, he is in danger of being himself involved in a 
          ruin, which was at first only designed against his 
          Ministers. Nor is a standing army of any effect in 
          such circumstances. The dispute in <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="indirect">New England</placeName> 
          is of the more weight, because it is one of the best and 
          most powerful Colonies we have in the <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="secondary">West Indies</placeName>. 
          Oppression and arbitrary sway generally take their 
          rise in the most remote parts of a nation. For that 
          reason, he is particularly interested in New England, 
          " because I am afraid it should one time or other serve 
          as a precedent at Home." Enclosed, Recd. 31st May, 1731. Printed. 16 pp.</p>

        <p>Governor Belcher's answers to the queries sent from the Council of Trade 
          and Plantations, relating to <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>.
          <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="from">Portsmouth, N.H.</placeName>, 25th March, 1731. 
          i-iii Describes situation, boundaries and constitution. 
          (iv) The Trade is lumber and fish. The number of 
          shipping belonging to the Province are five consisting 
          of about 500 tons, and there are about 3 or 400 tons 
          of other shipping that trade here annually. Seafaring 
          men, about 40. The trade is much the same as it 
          hath been for ten years past. (v) The Province 
          makes use of all sorts of Brittish manufactures, 
          amounting to about 5000£. sterling pr. annum, which 
          are had principally from <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName>. (vi) The trade to 
          other Plantations is to the <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="indirect">Caribbee Islands</placeName>, whither 
          we send lumber and fish, and receive for it rum, sugar, 
          molasses and cotton. The trade to <placeName ref="#europe" role="indirect">Europe</placeName>, is to 
          <placeName ref="#es" role="secondary">Spain</placeName> or <placeName ref="#pt" role="secondary">Portugal</placeName>
          in the above mentioned commodities, from whence our vessels bring home salt, (vii) The 
          method appointed to prevent illegal trade is by a 
          Collector appointed at home, (viii) The natural 
          produce is timber, principally oak, pine, hemlock, 
          ash, beech and birch and fish, and they are the only 
          commodities of the place. The timber is generally 
          manufactur'd into beams, plank, knees, boards, 
          clap-boards, shingle and staves, and sometimes into 
          house-frames ; the value annually exported to Europe 
          and the West India Islands, is about 1000£. sterling. 
          Mem. Besides what is above mentioned, the coasting 
          sloops from Boston carry from hence thither in fish 
          and timber about 5000£. per annum, (ix) No mines 
          yet discovered except a small quantity of iron ore in 
          two or three places, (x) Inhabitants, about 10,000 
          whites and 200 blacks, (xi) They are increased about 
          4000 this ten years last past, 1000 of which (at least) 
          are people from <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName> lately come into and settled 
          in the Province. Another reason of the increase of 
          late more than formerly, is a peace with the Indians 
          the four last years, (xii) The Militia, about 1800, 
          consists of two regiments of foot with a troop of horse 
          in each, (xiii) There is one fort or place of defence 
          called <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">Fort William and Mary</placeName>, situate on
          <placeName ref="#us_nh_newcastle" role="direct">the great island in Newcastle</placeName>, which commands the entrance of 
          <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="direct">Piscataqua river</placeName>, but is in poor low circumstances, 
          much out of repair, and greatly wanting stores of war, 
          there not being one barrel of gunpowder at this time 
          there, (xiv) There are no Indians in this Province 
          now in time of peace (xv), nor in the neighbourhood, except in 
          <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">the Eastern parts of the Massachusetts Bay</placeName>,
          and their number and strength we are not 
          acquainted with, (xvi) No neighbouring Europeans
          except French who are extreamly numerous at <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="indirect">Cape Briton</placeName> etc. (xvii) The effect which the 
          French settlements have on this Province is, that 
          the Indians are frequently instigated and influenced 
          by them to disturb the peace and quiet of this Province, 
          we having been often put to a vast expence both of 
          blood and treasure to defend ourselves against their 
          outrages, (xviii) The revenue is 396£ by excise, 
          which is appropriated towards the Governor's salary, 
          and three or four barrels of gunpowder from the 
          shipping, which is spent at the Fort, there is no other 
          revenue but by tax on polls and estates. (xix) 
          Ordinary expense of the Government is about 1500£. 
          etc. Extraordinary and contingent charges as repairs 
          of the Fort, powder etc. about 500£. more. (xx) The 
          establishments are 600£. salary on the Governor, 8s. 
          per diem on each Councillor, and 6s. per diem on each 
          Representative during the session of General Assembly, 
          and 150£. per annum on the officers and soldiers at the 
          Fort. There is no other establishment, civil or 
          military, but the Assembly make allowances from 
          time to time as they see meet to the Treasurer, 
          Secretary etc. The Judges, Justices, Sheriffs, Clerks 
          and all other officers fees are fix'd by a law to be paid 
          by the parties whom they serve, but they have nothing 
          out of the Treasury. All the officers, civil and military, 
          hold their places by commission from the Governor 
          except the Councillors appointed by the King, the 
          Recorder of deeds chosen by the General Assembly, 
          the Clerks of Courts nominated by the Judges of the 
          said Courts respectively, and select men, assessors, 
          constables, tithing men and other town officers chosen 
          by the towns at their respective town meetings.

        <p>Sir William Keith to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. I have in obedience to your Lordships' commands 
          examined the above etc., and I am humbly of opinion, that 
          H.M. may be advised to pass such a grant etc. (i) Because 
          until some such settlement be actually made by a numerous 
          active people from behind <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="direct">the Great Mountains</placeName> all along to 
          the <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="direct">River Messussippi</placeName>,
          I conceive it will be impossible to prevent 
          foreigners from setling those rich lands in the middle of
          <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">the Continent</placeName> which undoubtedly belong to the Crown of Britain 
          and the possession whereof are absolutely necessary to secure 
          and defend from future danger the valuable colonies already 
          setled on the coast and on this side the mountains, (ii) Because 
          such an improvement or inlet to a trade with the numerous native 
          Indians on <placeName ref="#lk_great" role="indirect">the Lakes</placeName> and the branches of the Messussippi will 
          give a new and large vent to the exportation of course woolings 
          and other British manufactures fit for the traffick which is 
          continually decaying at present in all the Colonies on this side
          the mountains, the game there being wasted and the Indians 
          reduced to a very small number. (iii) Because when this 
          Colony is settled etc., it will infallibly raise the vast tracts of 
          lands on each side as far West as the banks of the Messussippi 
          to a considerable value which without such a settlement can 
          never be of any use to the Crown of Britain, but on the contrary 
          will be a prey to foreigners and a continual annoyance to the 
          Colonies on this side the mountains, (iv) Because the European 
          market etc. seems to be overcharged with the present product 
          of our Colonies on the main such as tobacco, rice, corn etc. 
          which forces the people into trifling manufactures of their own, 
          and discourages or lessens the exportations from Great Britain, 
          whereas by the settlement proposed where the people can have 
          no access to navigation a new scene is open'd for the produce 
          of silk, hemp, flax, potash, wines etc. ; besides the vast extent 
          of Indian trade already mention'd. (v) Because there is no prospect of ever making such a settlement 
          by slow degrees with such a handfull of people as can be spared 
          at any one time from <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> or
          <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName>, and therefore it is adviseable by such 
          a grant as this to tempt or induce a large body of foreigners to 
          bring over their effects and subject themselves in this manner 
          to the Dominion of Britain, under which no doubt they will 
          rejoyce to feel the happy effects of a resonable freedom, (vi) 
          Because this settlement and the improvment of the lands being 
          to be carried on at the general expence of the setlers themselves 
          and not out of the estates of the persons to be named in the 
          patent, the success will probably depend on its being evidently 
          the interest of the patentees to invite the setlers on much easier 
          terms than would in all likelihood be obtain'd from persons of 
          overgrown estates and opulent fortunes, for it is a certain truth 
          that where large quantitys of land in America have fallen into 
          the hands of such proprietors they have been rarely sought 
          after and commonly very slow in improvement besides persons 
          of a low degree in life who are known amongst their equals to 
          be morally honest and industrious will sooner perswade a 
          multitude into a voluntary expedition of this nature than those 
          of greater wealth and higher rank who are ever liable to the 
          suspicion and jealousy of the vulgar, (vii) Because let the 
          patentees in such a case be men of what condition or estate you 
          please, the only security which the Crown can depend on is a 
          limitation in the patent that the lands shall actually be setled 
          in a certain time or the grant shall be void and from the nature 
          and scituation of the place proposed if 100 familys once sit 
          down there will be no room to apprehend any loss or ill 
          consequences from such a beginning. (viii) Because if this 
          proposition should be rejected at this time, it is uncertain 
          whether an application of the like nature made by foreigners 
          to the Court of <placeName ref="#fr" role="secondary">France</placeName> would not readily be accepted perhaps 
          on terms not very agreeable to the interest of Great Britain.

          Governor Hunter to the Council of Trade and Plantations.
          Encloses duplicate of 11th Feb. etc. Continues: 
          The several resolutions of the Assembly in the said letter 
          mention'd have since that been pass'd into four acts, transmitted 
          herewith, vizt. : (i) An act for raising several sums of money 
          and applying the same to several uses. This act is commonly 
          call'd the Additional duty bill and varies little in substance 
          from the annual bills which usually passes under the same 
          title, only in this particular, that they have rais'd the duty 
          upon the import, and export of negroes from ten shillings pr. 
          head to fifteen in the former, and from twenty shillings pr. 
          head to thirty on the latter, (ii) An act for raising a tax by the 
          poll, and on trades, offices and rents. In this act 12d. per head 
          is laid upon every negro and 3d. pr. head upon all cattle, horses, 
          mares, asses and mules, and the trades, offices and rents are 
          taxed as usual. It is computed that this bill will raise about 
          6000£., and it is appropriated intirely for an additional sub- 
          sistance to the officers and soldiers of H.M. two Regiments, 
          (iii) An act to oblige the several inhabitants to provide themselves 
          with sufficient number of white people, or pay certain sums of money 
          in case they shall be deficient, and for laying a duty upon shipping 
          the same to several uses. This act is what is commonly call'd 
          our Deficiency bill, and the deficiency being 26£. the same as 
          last year, it is believed the inhabitants will rather chuse to keep 
          their complement of white men and women than pay so high 
          a tax ; if so this bill will raise but little money. The duty 
          upon shipping has been inserted in former bills, but generally 
          appropriated to the repairing the walls at <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName>;
          in this bill it is given as well as the deficiency for an additional
          subsistence to the two Independent Companys, and the 
          overplus (if any) to such other uses as the Assembly shall direct, 
          (iv) An act for appropriating and applying money for the 
          additional subsistence of the officers and soldiers of the two regiments 
          arrived and for other uses, and ascertaining the voluntary rewards 
          to be allowed for the services they perform, and to oblige such parishes 
          as have not already made up their accompts and paid their arrears 
          to do the same in a prefixed time. This act appropriates all the 
          money arising by the three acts abovemention'd and not already 
          appropriated for and towards an additional subsistence to the 
          two Regiments etc., each Commissioned Officer resident on the 
          Island 20s. pr. week, to each private man 5s. pr. week, the 
          Officers' pay to commence from the day of their landing here, 
          and the private men's to take place so soon as the King's 
          provisions they brought with them should be expended, the 
          additional subsistance to continue only for six months and no 
          longer, tho' the fund be for one whole year this bill ; this bill 
          also obliges the parishes where the troops are or shall be sent 
          to provide good and convenient barracks, and allotts 12 negroes 
          to attend each company to be allow'd and paid for by the 
          Church Wardens of such parishes where the troops are quartered, 
          and a reward of 10£. is given for each rebellious negro the soldiers 
          shall either kill or take alive ; there is also in this bill two small 
          appropriations of 150£. and 100£. which the publick stood 
          engaged for, and the Council making no objections to this bill 
          nor the other three, I gave my consent to them, and finding the 
          Assembly not in a disposition to enter upon any other business 
          I did at their own request grant them a recess. On 2nd March 
          I summon'd a Council who gave it as their unanimous opinion 
          that the Assembly should be dissolved, which [I] did accordingly 
          by proclamation ; the chief motives which induced me to joyn 
          in opinion with them are, that this Assembly had already sat 
          three years, that in this last session great heats and disputes 
          arose about allowing an additional subsistance to the troops, 
          in so much that it was all that the friends of the Government 
          could obtain in the House to provide for them for six months 
          to which the words "and no longer" were added, and tho' I had 
          so often recommended to this Assembly several very material 
          things for the wellfare of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Country</placeName>, such as the better settling 
          the uncultivated lands, and giving due encouragement to white 
          people to become inhabitants, and to consider on some proper 
          measures to regain credit (now almost at a stop) and to establish 
          the value of our coin, yet they neglected doing any thing upon 
          those heads, tho' apparently for their own good. The merchants 
          began to be uneasie, and as I am credibly inform'd wish'd for 
          a disolution, so that I acquiest in giving the country a new 
          choice. Writts were accordingly issued for calling a new 
          Assembly to meet on the fourth of May, and the elections are 
          just over and by what I can guess I hope we shall have a better 
          disposed Assembly, there are more merchants in it than in the 
          last and about one half are new Members, tho' several of the 
          old who were there before meerly for protection have by their 
          industry got in again, etc. Encloses Minutes of Council to 9th 
          March, and Journals of the Council and of the late Assembly, 
          " but as there is nothing of great moment in them, I shall not 
          trouble your Lordships with any particular observations." 
          Continues : The troops are gone to the several parishes to be 
          barrack'd as the Act directs, and I hope in a short time they 
          will be better reconciled to their quarters, the Gentlemen of 
          fortune in the Island being very kind to them. They write me 
          from <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, where Admiral Stewart now is,
          that all the troops there are in perfect health, and considering the infancy 
          of that settlement pritty well accommodated. Since Capt. 
          Peters's party who burnt the negro town were disbanded, the 
          rebellious slaves have made incurtions upon some of the out 
          settlements which makes me believe that they are dispersing 
          themselves into small bodys. I shall take all possible care to 
          make the troops usefull and to encourage the country voluntary 
          partys to pursue them. By the last advices from <placeName ref="#pa_portobello" role="direct">Porto Bello</placeName>
          we have an account that the Fair was to begin about the latter 
          end of this month, that there was a great deal of money already 
          arrived from <placeName ref="#pe_lima" role="indirect">Lima</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#pa" role="indirect">Panama</placeName> and more hourly expected, 
          and that it was generally believed the cargo of the <placeName ref="#pacific" role="secondary">South Sea</placeName>
          ship Prince William would come to a very great market, etc.

          <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> has usually consisted of twelve members and no more, 
          which number is at present compleat ; But if H.M. shall think

          should not be of opinion to advise H.M. to augment the 
          number of his Council in Jamaica, he may notwithstanding 
          restore Mr. Ayscough to his ancient rank either immediately 
          or upon his arrival in Jamaica, giving orders at the same

          These draughts are copied from those which were

          the two last articles in the Instructions only, by the 
          first of which Capt. Clinton is directed to enquire what 
          effect has attended the Commission given to his 
          predecessor for creating Justices of Peace and other 
          Civil Officers ; how those Officers have behaved 
          themselves in the execution of their trust, whether 
          the people have paid due obedience to their authority, 
          or what obstructions have been given thereto. By 
          the other article directions are given for framing a 
          scheme of the quantities of fish taken annually at

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. It is his 
          duty and honour to acquaint his Grace with the affairs of 
          his Government. Hopes that his letters of Jan. 23 will acquit 
          him from Col. Dunbar's false complaint. Col. Dunbar's Lieut. 
          having deserted <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">the fort</placeName> (v. Jan. 11 no. 6, encl. :)
          the Sheriff went into it and siezed the robbers he was in quest of, so, "had I 
          had any design on the fort, I might have kept or demolisht it." 
          Begs for a line from his Grace in his justification etc. Continues :
          Notwithstanding Collo. Dunbar's vile representation of me 
          I hear by the late ships from <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName> he is appointed my Lieut. 
          Govr. in <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, this I can scarce believe and would 
          humbly pray of your Grace it may not be so. For how is it 
          possible, My Lord Duke, that the King's service and the good 
          of that Province can be carry'd an end with tolerable quiet, and 
          satisfaction while I must have an officer under me diametrically 
          opposite to me. Let me therefore once more beg it of your 
          Grace as a singular favour, that Collo. Sherburn (whom I formerly 
          mention'd) may be my Lieut. Govr. in New Hampshire etc. 
          Continues : I dissolv'd the Assembly of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">this Province</placeName> the 24th 
          currant after a session of upwards ten weeks, and have issued 
          writs for a new one to be held 26th of next month, in conformity 
          to the Royal Charter, and I now inclose to your Grace the votes 
          of the Assembly from my last to the compleating of this session, 
          by which it will be seen that the Assembly has done nothing in 
          complyance with the King's Instruction either as to fixing a 
          salary on H.M. Govr. or paying the arrearages so justly due to 
          their late Govr.'s children. As to the latter I have no 
          expectation of the Assembly of this Province paying those 
          poor orphans one farthing altho' they had voted the late Govr. 
          Burnett 6000£ a few days before his death, yet now they are 
          not willing to pay what was due to that time being 3400£. As 
          to the fixing a salary etc., I have no reason to think they will 
          ever do anything further or nearer to it than the bill transmitted 
          Dec. 10th past etc. Continues : Yet might I have the royal 
          leave to sign such a bill I should not doubt it's being a good 
          security for the Govr.'s support. I would therefore humbly 
          pray of your Grace that I might have the King's leave to receive 
          my support in that manner, or some other way that the King 
          may think proper. For with great deference to your Grace I 
          believe it will not be thought reasonable that I must go on to 
          support the King's honour in the character of his Govr. at the 
          expence of my own estate. I can assure your Grace that it's 
          not possible to live in any tolerable figure as the King's Govr. 
          with what H.M. has so moderately requir'd of this Province 
          for a salary to his Govr. and was it fixt agreeable to the King's 
          Instruction, no gentn. with the best husbandry could lay up 
          one farthing at the year's end. I am told the House of Repre- 
          sentatives are addressing H.M. to take off the force of several 
          of his royal Instructions to me. I hope your Grace will give 
          no countenance to an attempt of this nature till I am serv'd 
          with a copy of the said Address or Memorial, that I may make 
          a return to your Grace, and say how far the granting what they 
          are desiring might affect the honour and interest of the Crown, 
          and upon receiving your Grace's commands in this matter, I 
          shall with the greatest fidelity to H.M. return my answer to 
          your Grace etc. I am surpriz'd at the assurance of the House 
          of Representatives to be asking favours of the King, while they
          will not pay the least decent or dutifull respect to his orders. 
          But they are daily endeavoring to incroach upon the little 
          power reserv'd to the Crown in the Royal Charter, of which 
          your Grace may be assur'd I will part with none without my 
          royal Master's orders. I think they have too much already 
          unless they us'd it with more good manners to the King, and 
          more to the benefit of their countrey. Signed, J. Belcher.

          of Customs etc. Has lately received advice of some fresh opposi- 
          tion to the Act for improving the staple of tobacco, with strong 
          insinuations as if it was calculated to lessen the quantity of 
          tobacco, raise the price in foreign markets and so injure H.M.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Committee

          The inhabitants of the <placeName ref="#bm" role="direct">Bermuda Islands</placeName> are the 
          only people concerned in the whale fishery there, and they 
          have not hitherto made any objection to the paying for licences 
          on this accompt to their Governor. But notwithstanding this, 
          if your Lordships should be of opinion that this Instruction 
          lately given for preventing the Governor from granting licences 
          shou'd still continue in force in Bermuda since the benefit 
          thereof will wholly result to the inhabitants of those islands, 
          it would seem reasonable that they should make the Governour 
          some satisfaction for it, and that he should be instructed to
          recommend in H.M. name to the Assembly of Bermuda, that 
          they do take the proper means for raising and paying an 
          adequate salary to him in lieu thereof not exceeding the annual 
          sum of 100£., because the whale licences have always been 
          computed to him as part of his salary to that value. [C.O. 38, 8. pp. 156-158.]</p>

        <p>Petition of John Yeamans, Agent of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> to the 
          Council of Trade and Plantations. There is a standing 
          instruction, that in the absence of the Capt. General of the 
          <placeName ref="#leeward" role="direct">Leeward Islands</placeName>, the Lt.-General shall have the chief command, 
          and in his absence the Lt. Govr. of <placeName ref="#nevis" role="direct">Nevis</placeName>, and in his absence 
          the President of the Councill there. It may be of ill consequence 
          to oblige the Lt. Governor of the other islands to receive their 
          orders from the Lt. Governor or President in Nevis, not only 
          on account of the inferior rank and value that island holds 
          among the rest, but also because it is situated to the leeward 
          of Antigua and <placeName ref="#ms" role="indirect">Montserrat</placeName>. There has been no person at the 
          head of Nevis for several years resident there bearing H.M. 
          Commission. As the Lt. General is in a few days expected in 
          <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName>, the chief command must devolve on the President 
          of Nevis etc. Antigua is generally esteemed the most considerable
          of the Leeward Islands on account of its produce, and is 
          by reason of its strength, situation and the convenience of its 
          harbours, of much more consequence to the Crown than either 
          of the rest. It lies to windward of all the rest, and in case of 
          any attempt from an enemy, orders may be dispatched and 
          succours from thence landed in a night's time, in any of the 
          other islands, which could not without great difficulty and 
          length of time be dispatched from either of the said islands to 
          Antigua, because the vessels that carry them must ply to 
          windward, and run the risque of being intercepted by an enemy. 
          'Tis owing to these advantages, as memorialist concieves, that 
          the Capt. General is obliged by his Instructions to reside in 
          Antigua nine months in the year ; that it has always been 
          thought necessary to keep the greatest part of H.M. forces 
          there, and that this is the station appointed for the King's 
          ships of warr, unless when the service requires they should be 
          out upon the cruize. It seems where the greatest strength is etc. 
          Prays that the Lt. Governor of Antigua may be appointed to 
          command in chief in the absence of the Capt. and Lt. General 
          etc. Endorsed, Recd. 17th, Read 21st May, 1731. 2 1/3 pp.

          Same to Same. Representation upon Act of <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName>
          for amending the staple of tobacco etc. Quote views of Mr. Fane, 
          Lt. Gov. Gooch, and the Commissioners of Customs, and 
          the Agent for Virignia. (v. supra.) The most considerable 
          merchants in the tobacco trade concurred with the Lt. Govr. 
          and Agent of Virginia in desiring that the act might be confirmed. 
          Continue :--We are obliged however to take notice to your 
          Majesty, that some time since a law of this kind, which had 
          been in force about three years, was repealed at the desire of 
          the merchts., which in many particulars bore a very near 
          resemblance to the act in question, tho' they now seem to have 
          altered their opinion upon that subject, yet since the 
          Commissrs. of the Customs do apprehend that this act may be 
          prejudicial to your Majesty's revenue at home, we could not 
          advise the immediate confirmation of it. But, considering that 
          this act is calculated to recover the credit of so important a 
          staple as that of tobacco, considering it contains many clauses 
          well intended for the prevention of frauds, and that your 
          Majesty's quit-rents and the duty of 2s. upon every hogshead 
          of tobacco in Virginia may be thereby improved, because the 
          same will for the future be paid in better tobacco than formerly ; 
          we are humbly of opinion that your Majesty may be pleased 
          to suffer this act to lye by probationary, until the effects of it 
          may be seen. This being a temporary law, will of itself expire 
          in four years, but, by the method we humbly propose, it will be 
          always in your Majesty's power to repeal the same within that 
          term, if it shall be found prejudicial to your Majesty's revenue, 
          or to the trade of your subjects. [C.O. 5, 1366. pp. 61-71.]</p>

          Order of Committee of Privy Council. Referring enclosed memorial
          to the Council of Trade and Plantations for their report.
          Signed, W. Cary. Endorsed, Recd. 21st May, Read 8th June, 1731. 3/4 p. Enclosed, 
          188. i. Petition of Thomas Beake, Agent for <placeName ref="#stchristophers" role="direct">St. Christophers</placeName>, 
          to the King in Council. The Legislature of said island 
          finding that the fees in the Court of Chancery were 
          very grievous, and that some of them had a law for 
          their sanction and that in other the Secretary had 
          bound himself by no rule but his own will, and that in 
          several other branches of his office, and particularly 
          in the Ordinaries he had raised his own fees and the 
          Governor's to near the double of what they are settled 
          at by law, and Wavell Smith the Secretary having 
          of late set no bounds to his fees, occasioned a generall 
          dissatisfaction and outcry among the people, and some 
          instances of it happening to appear in proof before the 
          Assembly, when the Chief Justice and Mr. Smith were 
          heard at the barr of their house upon a contest between 
          them, and the Assembly being then upon a bill for 
          regulating fees they thought it proper to enquire into 
          the Secretary's fees and to redress any grievance that 
          might arise therefrom. To this end on 19th Dec. 
          1729 the Assembly appointed a Committee to enquire 
          what fees were then taken by the Officers attending 
          the Courts of Justice etc., with power to send for 
          persons, papers and records. Mr. Smith allarmed at 
          such an order and well knowing his actions would not 
          bear examination, when the Committee summoned 
          him and his deputy to attend with an account of such 
          fees, himself refused to attend, and sent his Deputy 
          with an account only of what fees he took in the Courts 
          of King's Bench and Common Pleas, and of no other 
          fees in his other offices etc. On 30th Dec. therefore 
          it was resolved by the House that he was guilty of an 
          act of disobedience to its authority, but deferred 
          passing any censure upon him, to see whether he would 
          make any excuse and produce his docquett of fees and 
          offer himself to be examined thereupon etc. But in 
          defiance and contempt of the House, he went off to 
          <placeName ref="#ag" role="indirect">Antigua</placeName>, whereby it was evident he refused to comply 
          with the orders of the House etc. Whereupon the 
          House addressed the Governor to suspend him from 
          the Council until H.M. pleasure should be known,           
          (21st April). The Council on the same day resolved 
          that his refusing to attend the Committee in order to 
          his being examined was a great contempt and indignity 
          offered to that House, and that such his refusall was 
          a presumptious offence. They also advised the 
          Commander in Chief to send a copy of the Assembly's 
          address and their resolve to Mr. Smith requiring him 
          to send immediately a satisfactory answer, in default 
          whereof they then advised his Honour to suspend him 
          from his office as Councillor. Mr. Smith sent (19th 
          May) an answer upon which the House resolved that 
          it was untrue and evasive and reflecting on the honour 
          and justice of the House and in a conference with the 
          Council resolved to request his Honour to suspend 
          Mr. Smith. Prays that H.M. will remove him from the Council etc.

          and Government, and a readiness to comply with all H.M, 
          Instructions to the utmost of their power, which I trust will be 
          very evident to your Grace when you shall see the Journal of 
          the Assembly. I am preparing a large map of this province 
          for H.M. view, drawn from several observations I collected 
          when I was Surveyor Genll, of this Province and many helps 
          I have received from several gentlemen of this and the neigh- 
          bouring Governments, the particulars whereof shall com- 
          municate to your Grace when I send the map, etc. Signed,

          to the King. We etc. with chearfulness lay hold of 
          this opportunity on our first meeting after the publication
          of your Majesty's purchase of the sovereignty 
          of this Province ; to acknowledge with the profoundest 
          gratitude the many blessings we enjoy under your 
          auspicious and happy reign. It is with the greatest 
          pleasure we observe your Majesty and our gracious 
          Queen Caroline always intent on promoting the 
          happiness of all your people ; and altho' we are so 
          remote from your Royal presence, we find ourselves 
          nevertheless assured of your fatherly care and concern.
          We are in duty bound to acknowledge as a 
          particular mark of your indulgence, the placing 
          over us H. E. George Burrington Esq. etc., who by 
          his behaviour during the time he governed this 
          Province for the Lords Proprietors rendred himself 
          very agreable to the people by the great care he then 
          shewed in his due administration of Justice, and in 
          promoting the wellfare of this Province ; on which 
          occasion his indefatigable industry and the hardships 
          he underwent in carrying on the settlement at  
          <placeName ref="#us_nc_capefear" role="direct">Cape Fear</placeName> deserves our thankful remembrance.
          The Governor having laid before us several of your 
          Majesty's Instructions relating to this Province, we 
          think it our duty thankfully to acknowledge your 
          Majesty's great clemency and goodness expressed in 
          those Instructions toward the people of this your 
          Province ; and as some of them do necessarily require 
          that your Majesty should be informed of the state 
          and condition of this country, we have directed a 
          Committee to transmit a true state thereof. Pray for 
          H.M. long reign and the succession of the House of Hanover.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Lt. Governor 
          Gooch. Acknowledges letters etc. of 29th June and 7th Sept., 
          1729, 9th Jan., 9th April, 29th May, 23rd July and 14th 
          Sept., 1730, and 12th and 27th Feb., 1731. Continue: 
          We commend your punctuality in corresponding with us, 
          and we should not have been wanting in proper returns to 
          you, but the subject matter of most of the above-mentioned 
          letters related principally to your scheme for improving the 
          staple of tobacco, and the law which you pass'd in consequence 
          of it, which being matters of very great consequence, required 
          a very mature consideration, and it is but very lately that we 
          have been able to come to any determination concerning them, 
          wherefore we chose to defer writing to you, till we could give 
          you some account of them in our letter. Upon considering 
          this law, we thought it for H.M. service, and for the service of 
          all those who are concern'd in the trade to <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName>,
          to receive the different opinions of such persons as might give us any 
          further light into this matter ; and as we have met with some 
          who were very sanguine for the confirmation of this act, and 
          some as sanguine for the repeal of it, we have chose the midway,
          and have offer'd our opinion to H.M. that the same may lye 
          by probationary, in order to try the good effects you expect 
          may result from it ; As the pressing instances you have made, 
          and the many reasons you have offer'd to us in behalf of this 
          act, have greatly weigh'd with us in our resolution concerning 
          the same, we think it the more incumbent upon you, supposing 
          H.M. should be graciously pleased to confirm our report, to 
          have a watchfull eye over the persons who are to put this act 
          in execution, that no partiality be shewn to any person, and 
          thereby bad tobacco exported from your Colony ; For we 
          must upon this occasion remind you, that an act of this nature 
          was pass'd in 1713, and after some years experience was repealed 
          in 1717, at the desire of all the Virginia merchts., who did 
          assure the then Board of Trade, that the Agents, who by that 
          act were the same officers, and had the same duty as those who 
          by this are called inspectors, did permit as much trash tobacco, 
          to be exported as before the passing that act. This was one of 
          the reasons why we did not propose your law to be confirm'd, 
          and because we shall now have it in our power to advise the 
          King to repeal the same, as we certainly shall do, if we find by 
          experience that this act does not answer the intent of its passing, 
          better than the other law did, in which case the Colony 
          of Virginia will have been put to a very great expence to no 
          purpose ; we must therefore repeat once more, that it is the 
          more incumbent upon you to take great care of the execution 
          of this law, since you have been so very pressing for its 
          confirmation. We have recommended Col. Harrison to be of 
          the Council etc., and he has been appointed accordingly. It 
          was not possible for us to comply with your request in favour 
          of Mr. Armistead, having been for some time before engag'd 
          to recommend Col. Bray, as we have now done in the room of 
          Mr. Page. We are glad to find that you have at last brought 
          the negroes to a quiet submission, and we hope that by your 
          prudent management they may be kept so for the future. 
          Your letter of 14th Dec. last, wherein, you say, you gave us 
          an account of the insurrection of the negroes, never came to 
          our hands. [C.O. 5, 1366. pp. 71-74.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. 
          Representation upon Act of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName>, 1728,
          to supply the defects of an act for constituting a Court of Chancery etc. There 
          are many provisions in this Act for regulating the proceedings 
          of the Court of Chancery in Antigua, and for supplying some 
          defects in a former act referr'd to in the title. But the main 
          purport of the act, is to enable the Lieut. General in the absence 
          of your Majesty's Capt. General, the Lieut. Govr. of Antigua, 
          in their absence, and the President of the Council, in the absence 
          of the other three Officers aforesaid, to preside in and hold 
          Courts of Chancery there, for the hearing of causes and the 
          dispatch of such business as shall be depending in the said 
          Court. We have taken the opinion of Mr. Fane, one of your 
          Majesty's Counsel learned in the law, and he conceives the 
          several provisions therein contained, not to be lyable to 
          any objection in point of law, save in one particular only, 
          where it is attempted to exclude all Courts held in any other 
          country except in the island of Antigua, from making decrees 
          or orders in case of suit for lands, tenements or hereditaments, 
          where the interest or thing sued for, shall lye in that island, 
          and in case of personal demands where the person or persons 
          of the defendant or defendants are or shall be resident in the 
          said island, for tho' he is of opinion that this clause will not 
          be sufficient to restrain the jurisdiction of any of the Courts 
          in <placeName ref="#gb" role="secondary">Great Britain</placeName>, yet he thinks, it seems to be particularly 
          calculated against the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery 
          here, which is an attempt which ought to be discountenanced. 
          We have likewise been attended by several merchants and 
          planters, who are desirous that this act should receive your 
          Majesty's royal approbation. The principal reason offered 
          in support of this act, and contained in the preamble, are, that 
          the inhabitants labour under great delays and inconveniences 
          in the prosecuting of their rights in Chancery, by reason of the 
          Chief Governor's frequent and long absence from Antigua, and 
          from a power exercised by the said Govrs. of granting and 
          dissolving of injunctions in causes depending in Antigua, whilst 
          they are resident in some other of the <placeName ref="#leeward" role="indirect">Leeward Islands</placeName>;
          and we are of opinion that proper remedies should be provided 
          against these evils. We have no objection therefore to such 
          parts of this act as relate simply to the regulation of proceedings 
          in the Court of Chancery ; but we cannot approve that part 
          of it, whereby the Lieut. General, in the absence of your 
          Majesty's Capt. General, or the Lt. Govr. etc. in their absence 
          are enabled to preside in and hold Courts of Chancery, because 
          we do apprehend that the appointment of Judges and 
          Chancellors, being a very material part of the royal prerogative, 
          ought always to be exercised immediately by your Majesty, 
          or, by some persons to whom your Majesty shall especially 
          delegate that power, and not by a clause in an act of Assembly, 
          and the rather, because your Majesty may from time to time 
          make such alterations or additions to your Royal orders and 
          appointments as may be suitable to the occasions and advantage 
          of your subjects, but an act of Assembly cannot be repealed, 
          whatever inconveniences may ensue from it, without the consent 
          of the people. The most proper method, therefore, in our 
          humble opinion, of attaining what is proposed by this act, 
          most suitable to your Majesty's royal prerogative, and equally 
          safe and expedient for the people of Antigua, would be, that 
          your Majesty should be pleased especially to appoint some 
          person in Antigua to preside as Chancellor, and execute all the 
          functions of that Office, in the absence of your Majesty's Capt. 
          General or Commander in Chief, by which means the course 
          of Justice would be continued without interruption, and the 
          complaint, which has been so much insisted upon, of granting 
          and revoking injunctions by the Governor General, when absent 
          from Antigua, might likewise be entirely removed. The only 
          objection to the doing of this now, arises from some words in 
          the first Chancery act already refer'd to, whereby it is presumed 
          your Majesty cannot, in any case or on any emergency, appoint 
          another person to preside in the said Court, during the residence 
          of the Commander in Chief in any other of the Leeward Islands, 
          because it is by that law enacted, that from henceforth all and 
          every Court and Courts of Chancery which shall be holden for 
          this island of Antigua, shall consist of and be holden by the 
          Capt. General or Governor in Chief etc., and five or more of the 
          Council of this island at least. But if this be a real difficulty 
          it is at least a difficulty which the Assembly of Antigua may 
          easily remove by a new law, whereby your Majesty may be 
          impowered, notwithstanding the aforesaid Chancery act, or 
          anything therein contained from time to time to nominate 
          such person or persons as your Majesty shall think most proper 
          to supply the duty of the Commander in Chief, and preside, 
          during his absence, in the Court of Chancery in Antigua, may 
          do ; But upon this occasion, we cannot help observing, that 
          great caution ought to be had in making concessions of this 
          sort to any Colony, when an uncommon favour already granted, 
          is made use of, as an argument to obtain another still more 
          extraordinary. The people of Antigua are already upon a 
          different footing from the rest of the Leeward Islands, by virtue 
          of the law which this act is intended to amend : For in Antigua 
          only the Councillors have the right of sitting and voting in the 
          Court of Chancery with your Majesty's Governor ; But if this 
          new act should pass, the Council with their President, may 
          some times have opportunities of deciding causes without the 
          assistance of the Capt. Genl., Lieut. Genl., or Lieut. Governor, 
          whose presence may reasonably be assumed to be some 
          check upon their proceedings, which might possibly be 
          subject to strong influences, from consanguinity at least, in 
          an island where all the principal inhabitants, by frequent 
          intermarriages, are nearly related. For all which reasons, we 
          humbly propose that your Majesty should be pleased to signify 
          your disallowance of this act. [C.O. 153, 15. pp. 98-105.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. Representation upon Act of 
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="direct">New York</placeName>, 1730, to prevent the taking 
          or levying on specialities more than the principal, interest and 
          cost of suit, and other purposes therein mentioned etc. Continue : 
          Mr. Fane has made several objections to the confirmation 
          of it, which are both of a legal and prudential nature. The Act 
          appears to have taken its rise from some late executions had 
          upon judgments obtained in the Province of New York, whereby 
          the whole penalties of the bonds have been levied instead of 
          the sums really due, and to prevent this practice for the future, 
          this law provides that if, upon any judgment obtained, or upon 
          actions brought and agreed before judgment, any plaintiff or 
          his attorney shall take or levy more than the principal debt, 
          lawful interest and costs of suit, the person or persons so 
          offending shall forfeit double damages to the party grieved, 
          with treble costs of suit, to be recovered in any Court of Record 
          in the province of New York. To this provision, it is objected 
          that according to the practice of the Law Courts in <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName>, 
          plaintiffs do always recover the whole penalties of their bonds, 
          but should they levy more than the real debt, with cost and 
          charges, the party grieved has a remedy by a bill in equity, in 
          which case the plaintiff shall refund with costs, and the people 
          of New York have not only the same opportunity of redressing 
          themselves in a Court of Equity, but likewise an easier way of 
          obtaining Justice, because their common law courts will, upon 
          motion, examine in a summary way into any wrong of that 
          sort, which is what the common law courts in England cannot 
          do, whereby the injured party is obliged to sue for relief in a 
          Court of Equity. It is likewise apprehended that this Act 
          will tend to multiply litigious suits at law, by encouraging the 
          debtor not to oppose or remonstrate against an unwarrantable 
          levy in execution of judgment, or what is still worse, by tempting 
          him to agree in appearance to any exorbitant demand of the 
          plaintiff, and accordingly to pay more than was really due to 
          him, with no other prospect than that of recovering double 
          damages and treble costs of suit, in which case, his gain upon 
          recovery would be proportionable to the money he had 
          knowingly paid in his own wrong. We therefore humbly 
          propose that your Majesty should be pleased to signify your 
          disallowance of it etc. [C.O. 5, 1125. pp. 162-164.]</p>

          Acknowledges letter of 9th Sept. Concludes : My Lords Commissioners desire 
          that you will constantly transmit to them authentick copies 
          of the laws passed in your Assembly, and also accounts of all 
          the publick transactions in your Government for the future. 
          PS. I find that by a letter from your predecessor Mr. 
          Saltonstall, dated so long since as 8th Aug., 1710, he promised 
          the then Lords Commrs. a copy of your Laws as soon as 
          they should come out of the Press ; tho' it has not yet been 
          received here. [C.O. 5, 1294. p. 29.]</p>

          Lt. Governor Gordon to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. On the 29th ult. I had the honour to receive 
          your Lordships' commands of 8th Sept. delivered to me by 
          Mr. Browne etc. I am so conscious, my Lords, of having done 
          nothing with relation to Mr. Brown but what is just and well 
          to be defended, that I may venture to assure your Lordships 
          his complaint shall receive a proper answer. I have given him 
          regular notice to attend the examinations on my side etc. with 
          leave to cross-examine ; and he hath already heard such 
          depositions as must make him ashamed to have troubled your 
          Lordships with an affair so frivolous with respect to me, and so 
          exceedingly dishonourable to himself etc. Continues : In 
          answer to a paragraph in your Lordships' said orders etc., when 
          I received a deputation from the Proprietors etc., I had their 
          instructions to correspond frequently with them, and to acquaint 
          them with the state of their Province, which I have punctually 
          done etc. ; I likewise knew it was my duty to acquaint H.M. 
          Ministers and particularly your Right Honourable Board, in 
          case anything of moment which might be for H.M. service 
          should occurr, and to acknowledge and pay due obedience to 
          those directions I should receive from them, which last I have 
          never neglected to doe. But in <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="direct">this inland Province</placeName>
          so few things happen of any consequence to H.M. interest, and scarce 
          any at all have happened since my arrival here, that I judged 
          it improper to take up your Lordships' time with matters of 
          so small importance. Signed, P. Gordon. Endorsed, Recd.

          Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Refers to letter of 26th April and encloses laws since passed in 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">N. Hampshire</placeName>. Continues : The people there 
          are still very desirous, that I might have the King's leave for 
          signing the bill I transmitted in Dec. last etc. Prays for dispatch 
          in that matter and for mandamuses for Mr. Waldron and Mr. 
          Gambling for the Council. Continues : I seldom have more 
          than six to attend in Council, which is a great prejudice to the King's service.
          The 26th ulto. I met the new Assembly of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">this Province</placeName>
          and by their Journal to this time now inclos'd your 
          Lordships will see, they are of the same stamp with the last 
          Assemblies. Nor have I the least expectation of their making 
          any step towards a complyance with the King's Instruction, 
          as to my support, nor do they seem to pay the least deference 
          to any thing that is called an Instruction. I must therefore 
          desire your Lordships wou'd send me the King's leave to receive 
          my support in the way the Assembly is willing to give it, for it 
          cannot be thought consonant to reason, justice or honour that 
          I should go on to support the character of the King's Governour 
          at the great expense of my own estate. With great submission 
          to your Lordships my taking the sum the King has appointed 
          me in the manner the Assembly are willing to pay it cannot 
          prevent or anyways affect what H.M. in his royal wisdom shall 
          think fit to do, for his own honour, in seeing that his orders 
          have all possible obedience paid them. I have in this and 
          every point acted with the strictest fidelity to the King's honour 
          and service, and it is a severe thing for his faithfull servants 
          to suffer in their estates as I have done ever since my arrival. 
          I hope your Lordships will consider my hard case, and let me 
          have the leave I desire, and was granted to former Governours, 
          who had Instructions of the nature of mine, etc. Signed, J. 
          Belcher. Endorsed, Recd. 5th July, Read 4th Aug., 1731.

          Minutes of Privy Council. Major General Hunter's 
          letter of 4th July, 1730, with the papers inclosed, representing 
          the defenceless condition of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> the orders sent to him 
          upon them in the Duke of Newcastle's several letters of 12th 
          Oct. and 9th and 30th Nov. were read. And Maj. Gen. 
          Hunter's letters of 23rd Jan., 11th Feb., 17th and 20th March 
          and 2nd and 3rd April giving an account of the receipt of those 
          orders, and of the arrival of the two Regiments at Jamaica 
          were also read. The Secretary at War acquainted the Lords 
          that he had received letters from Maj. Gen. Hunter of the 
          same date and to the same purpose, as also one fom Colo. 
          Hayes, dated Match 9, 1730/1, with advice of the defeat of the 
          negroes and the burning of <placeName ref="#jm_nannytown" role="direct">their town</placeName>; and representing the 
          bad condition of the quarters provided for the soldiers who 
          sicken and dye fast, and that only two companies of his regiment 
          are together ; the rest being dispersed in quarters all over the 
          island ; which letters were read. Several other letters from 
          officers and other persons at Jamaica (enumerated) were read, 
          all which agree in the account of the sickness of the regiments, 
          many of both regiments being ill of fevers and fluxes ; that it 
          increased daily ; that several officers and abundance of the 
          men were dead ; that at the funeral of Colo. Hayes the whole 
          Regmt. were in tears, the surviving Officers almost dead ; 
          that their men dyed daily ; and that the two regiments would 
          soon fall a victim : that their accommodations were not good ; 
          that no provision was made for them or care taken of them ; 
          that three Companies of each Regimt. were sent to <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, 
          a very unhealthy place, which were still on board, 
          quarters not being ready for them ; and the rest were disperst 
          all over the island ; and some in places where there were no 
          rebellious negroes ; except only two companies, that were 
          kept together ; that there seemed to be no want of the troops 
          there, unless it were to make them planters ; and if the two 
          Independant Companies were compleat, they would be more 
          in number than the detachment of the regiments which is 
          sent to that part where the rebellious negroes are ; that the 
          affair of the negroes is a trifle, that they had been defeated and 
          their town burnt ; that there had never been more than 30 of 
          them together, that the people of the Island did not value 
          them, nor were in general much pleased with the regiments. 
          A letter from the Lords Commrs. of the Admiralty, 15th 
          March, 1730/1 inclosing copy of one they had received from 
          Major General Hunter concerning the defenceless condition of 
          Jamaica, and his Grace's answer to them of 5th April, with 
          another letter from them of 1st May were read. Their Lordps., 
          upon consideration of the several letters, and finding great 
          difference in the accounts from ye Govr. of Jamaica, and the 
          officers and other persons there, as well with relation to the 
          health and condition of the regiments, as to the service and use 
          they may be of for the security of the island, and the suppressing 
          of the rebellious negroes ; and being informed, that Capt. Dent 
          is daily expected from thence, who is well acquainted with the 
          state and condition of the island, their Lordps. think it most 
          for H.M. service to deferr giving any oppinion in this matter 
          till such time as they have received further information from 
          Capt. Dent, and by the letters he will bring from Jamaica. In 
          the mean time the Board of Trade are desired to enquire of the 
          merchants what necessity they apprehend there may be for 
          the continuance of those regiments at Jamaica. 4 1/3 pp. [C.O. 5, 36. ff. 9-11.]</p>

          ye lands, but I am prosecuting them for it. <placeName ref="#rv_muscongus" role="direct">Moscougus river</placeName> 
          enters from the sea, abt. 12 miles N.E. from Fredericksfort, a 
          number of New England people who called themselves the 
          Moscougus Company, came to me upon my first arrival at 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="indirect">Boston</placeName> and when I told them of the King's intentions and 
          termes of settling that country, they in a very dutyfull manner 
          thankfully accepted thereof, and I told them that no others 
          should have those lands, and that all others of H.M. Protestant 
          subjects who would do the same should also settle where they 
          pleased. Accordingly those people are come and comeing 
          thither. I have called it <placeName ref="#us_ma_torrington" role="direct">Torrington</placeName>, wch. bounds on ye west 
          and N.W. upon Fredericksfort and Harrington ; Harrington 
          and Walpole lines meet, and Townsend and Newcastle ; the 
          people have agreed this season to cutt strait cart-roads from 
          towne, to build ferrys upon ye rivers and to erect beacons in 
          proper places, the soil is extraordinary and the country not 
          at all mountainous, it is covered with wood in veins, some 
          places red oak wch. is oriely fitt for potash, dry cask and firewood, 
          in other places white oak fitt for ship timber and wett cask, 
          some parts mostly spruce, and all intermixed with some ash, 
          birch, maple and popple or asp trees, very few pines and those 
          stunted trees which are onely fitt for boards and shingles, 
          without which no buildings can be carryed on. Every towne 
          has clay fitt for bricks, and which will be cheaper to ye people 
          than wooden houses ; great numbers of men are dayly flocking 
          hither, and I am now upon laying out another towne by the 
          name of Westmorland upon a <placeName ref="#lk_biscay" role="direct">fresh pond of thirty miles long</placeName> 
          above Walpole, they are now encouraged by letters from <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="secondary">London</placeName>
          that ye claims are all rejected, and I should not have presumed 
          to have proceeded thus farr but that I had ye same account 
          from London some months agoe, and there was an absolute 
          necessity for it, besides no claimants on these parts made any 
          application at home, but waited the issue of Mr. Waldo's 
          sollicitation wch. would determine all the rest, and he was to 
          have half of the lands he should get confirmed. If it had not 
          been for Doctor Cook and him, noe opposition would have ever 
          been made to the settlements, but all would have acquiesced, 
          as those of Muscougus had done, and to shew the nature of their 
          titles etc. repeats stay of John Brown (v. C.S.P. 17th Nov., 1730). 
          Continues : When I told some of ye purchasers of this affair, 
          they ownd they gave ye man ye mony but sayd it was in charity, 
          and he made them a present of the deed in return, wch. they
          layd no stress upon, haveing Indian deeds for ye same lands, 
          to wch. I have seen no less than 3 such titles from different Indns. 
          to different people ; I onely mention this to shew that I was 
          willing to make no distinction between the King's subjects but 
          receive all who would accept H.M. favour, this may prove Mr. 
          Waldoe's chief plea in his petition to be false, vizt. that I had 
          dispossd. several people from their antient possessions and 
          inheritances, whereas I do solemnly declare that there was but 
          one family between the island of <placeName ref="#is_arrowsic" role="boundary">Arrowzick</placeName> in Kennebeck river 
          and the truck-house at Georges 10 leagues eastward of 
          Fredericksfort, when I first came hither, namely Doctor 
          Winslow's, now at the town of Townshend, and he is there still 
          and was never disturbed nor threatend to be disturbed ; this 
          is all yt. I can think material for me to take notice of in answer 
          to that petition, but to observe that if your claim is allowed, 
          there are so many more of the same nature yt. H.M. can have 
          no reserve in that country for ye Royal Navy, and besides 
          allowing one Indian's title, is an acknowledgmt. that ye Indians 
          have a right to dispose of all ye rest of ye lands, and may sett 
          what vallue they please upon it, or refuse to sell, and thus the 
          planting a usefull Collony will be defeated, wch. besides a 
          handsome revenue to the Crowne will consume abundance of 
          English manufactures, and returns made for them in hemp, 
          flax and pottashes wch. <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> now purchases mostly with 
          ready mony, and from countrys whose friendship is precarious. 
          Mr. Waldo and his party being sensible of the weakness of their 
          title, have lately purchased an additional one, wch. they 
          imagined one Mr. Nelson had to all <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>. Mr. Nelson 
          is an antient gentleman near 80 years of age, was a relation to 
          Sr. Thomas Temple who was in these parts near seventy years 
          agoe, he confessed to Mr. Waldoes frds. when they offered to 
          treat with him for his title that he had no sort of right, and yt. 
          if any remain'd, derived from his uncle Sr. Thomas Temple it 
          must be in my Lord Cobham who is heir to him, but even his 
          Lordship had none, because Sir Thomas's grant for Nova Scotia 
          was but dureing his own life, if this be true the records in 
          England must prove it. Notwithstanding this honest 
          declaration from Mr. Nelson, Mr. Waldo's friends insisted 
          upon buying his title and offerd 100£. <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="secondary">New England</placeName> mony, 
          wch. he has wthin. this month accepted, and perfected deeds, 
          wch. no doubt will be trumped up at ye Council Board in 
          England before this can reach home ; this is a cheap purchase 
          for Nova Scotia, which to the eastward of Kennebeck river 
          will be upwards of fourscore millions of acres, and ye 100£. 
          not worth more than so many ounces of silver ; 'tis much an 
          easier purchase than Mr. Waldo would willingly have made 
          abt. 30 months agoe in England, when one day Mr. Gulston, 
          he and I dined at <placeName ref="#en_lon_pontacks" role="secondary">Pontacks</placeName> and talking of settling these parts, 
          wch. was then in agitation, Mr. Waldo sayd yt. he had some 
          pretentions to a neck of land between <placeName ref="#rv_stgeorge" role="boundary">St. Georges river</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#rv_penobscot" role="boundary">Penobscot</placeName>, and if I could putt him in a way how to gett his 
          claim confirmed by H.M. he would give a thousand guins. to 
          any one about Court who would serve him therein. I answered 
          that I did not know how or where to make any such application 
          of mony. Mr. Gulston I believe would scorn to lye and I 
          appeal to him for his testimony herein ; that claim of Mr. 
          Waldo and Compa. (as they call themselves) is near 600,000 
          acres, reckoning onely from St. Georges to Penobscot, but now 
          by his petition he would include Mt. Muscougos, wch. etc. 
          another sett of people claim and are actually settleing, waveing 
          any pretentions but under the new terms, which many of the 
          better sort of people tell me does ye more incourage them, 
          because they will be under a Kingly Governmt. and hope for 
          H.M. more immediate countenance, which these parts could 
          never expect from the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="indirect">Masachusetts Bay</placeName>, being at too great 
          a distance from them, and it may appear from ye addresses 
          contained in the 4 printed books sent by me to His Grace ye 
          Duke of Newcastle and to my Lords Commrs. for Trade 
          and Plantations soon after my arrival at Boston, that the 
          Masachusets people refused to build the fort at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="indirect">Pemaquid</placeName> as 
          being too remote from their Province, and therefore could be 
          of no advantage to them, the opposition now given to the 
          settlements is the pure effect of their principles for opposition 
          sake, and not with any designe of settleing it themselves, they 
          haveing land enough in the Masachusets province for 40,000 
          familys more than they have in ye country, besides the large 
          <placeName ref="#us_me" role="indirect">province of Main</placeName> which from
          <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="indirect">Piscatua River</placeName> to Kennebeck is nearer 100 than 90 miles, 
          30 of which at this time from <placeName ref="#us_me_northyarmouth" role="indirect">North Yarmouth</placeName>
          in <placeName ref="#by_casco" role="indirect">Casco Bay</placeName> has not 30 familys upon it, ye other 
          70 to Piscatua river, wch. parts it from <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">New Hampshire</placeName> has 
          onely one line of townships along ye seashore and those but 8 
          miles deep into the country, except on Piscatua river ye town 
          of <placeName ref="#us_me_berwick" role="indirect">Berwick</placeName> 15 miles from the sea ; there are but small 
          improvemts. in these towns, they live chiefly by their saw-mills, 
          and are not to be restraind by any law yet in being, nor can the 
          most diligent officers prevent such numbers of disobedient 
          people, who very little regard the King's authority and very 
          frequently insult his officers, a flagrant instance of this lately 
          happened to one Capt. Lancelot a master of a ship who was 
          attacqued, severely wounded and robbed, his wounds were 
          such as that the people imagined they had killed him by their 
          boasting that they had destroyed one Surveyor of ye Woods. 
          He was a little man and was taken for Mr. Slade one of my 
          Deputys at that time near ye same place upon his duty, who 
          sent his horse for Mr. Lancelot to carry him to a surgn., this 
          fact was related in one of the Boston newspapers, and is since 
          confirmed to me by Mr. Slade etc. Refers to and repeats part 
          of his letters Jan. 12th etc., the quit-rents due and the titles 
          produced by the inhabitants for the lands, " particularly Collo. 
          Westbrook." Continues : It may be worth consideration 
          at home whether to demand the said arrears, in default of 
          paymt. the title reverts to the Crowne ; all those patents were 
          so much esteemed that they are registered in the town books 
          of <placeName ref="#us_me_york" role="direct">York</placeName> which is the county towne etc. York is but 7 miles 
          from the river of Piscataqua, and thither upon all sessions and 
          sizes people from the west side of Kennebeck are obliged to 
          resort upon all occasions near 90 miles, and what is yet harder 
          upon them, they send representatives to Boston, 60 miles 
          westward of Piscatua, and must follow any appeals thither to 
          ye Governour and Council, and travel thro' the body of the 
          Governmt. of New Hampshire ; there are many people tearing 
          one another to pieces upon disputes of lands in the province of 
          Maine, many familys at Casco who have settled and improved 
          thereabouts for several years are now to be turn'd out by old 
          claimants to the same lands who have layn dormant, and they 
          are now to loose the benefit of their buildings and improvemts. 
          by some new comers, among whom are Mr. Waldo and Mr. 
          Westbrook who lately purchased the old titles for trifles, on 
          purpose for erecting saw mills, as those lands are chiefly covered 
          with large white pine trees. When I was at Casco in January 
          last, ye Selectmen came to me in behalf of many others, and 
          prayed me to represent their grievances home, and asked my 
          approbation to call a towne meeting to aggree upon a petition 
          to H.M. to annex them to this province, but I declined it, and 
          now I have fresh application to beg in the name (as they say 
          of 2/3) of the province of Maine that I would putt them in a way 
          to lay their grievances before H.M., and how they may be 
          annexed either to New Hampshire or Georgia, but I gave no 
          answer, than, that I could not appear in it, but if they would 
          send my petition to one of the Secretarys of State, or to my 
          Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations and send 
          substantial proof of their allegations it would be enquired 
          into, and an answer wd. be returnd to them. I beg pardon 
          for this long digression, and leave to observe the opinion of the 
          Indians of ye pretended sale of lands by their ancestors, they 
          say that their lands are unalienable, that their ancestors had 
          onely a natural right dureing their own lives, and could not 
          deprive their posterity of the same right, no more than they 
          could take away their lives, nor do they pretend to any such 
          right over their children, the tribes are much diminished, and 
          many of them extinct ; it is very observable that when any 
          settlemts. are made, ye Indians have insensibly decreased, and 
          when any tribe is reduced to a few, they quit that place and 
          incorporate with other tribes, and so the names of them are 
          extinct ; the descendants of some in whose names formal 
          deeds are trumpd. up, do, notwithstanding claim ye lands sold 
          by their ancestors, and have offerd to sell their right dureing 
          their own lives, but pretend to no more. In my first letter to 
          His Grace the Duke of Newcastle and to my Lords Commrs. 
          I acquainted them, upon my return from Fredericksfort, 
          that the Proprietor of ye lands there offered to sell his right 
          to me for a trifle. My answer was, before a great number of the 
          Indians, that I was not come there to buy lands, for yt. all 
          belonged to ye King of England who sent me to settle his 
          subjects here, and no man had a right to sell any, upon this the 
          Indians seemed grave and kept silence awhile, and then the 
          proprietor told me with a smile, that King George was welcome, 
          and I was welcome. I have in all my former letters sayd soe 
          much of this country and of ye many different claims and titles 
          to ye very same lands, yt. I can onely add, that if any of them 
          are allowed, it will lay foundations for eternal suits and disputes 
          among the people and endless appeals home, if ever this country 
          be settled under those claimts., and besides it will create quarrels 
          among ye descendants of the Indians who formerly sold, each 
          of them insisting that the title their ancestors gave, is best. 
          Upon the whole if H.M. allows one claim, he cannot avoyd 
          allowing all under ye same case and then he may give over any 
          expectation of ever hearing of a good settlement here or any 
          advantage to ye Crowne. In some of my former letters I gave 
          you an account of large claims eastward of Penobscot, one of 
          20 miles square to Mr. Winnet, now of ye Council of Nova 
          Scotia, by a grant from the French Governour before ye 
          reduction of yt. province. To conclude I beg leave to referr 
          to a printed case and state of the Crown's title to these lands 
          signed by Dr. Pinfold after ye former disputes before His late 
          Majesty in Council about ye year 1718, when for many reasons 
          therein mentioned, ye title was absolutely declared to be in the 
          Crowne. Now Sir in answer to what my Lords Commissioners 
          are pleased to say relateing to the expenses I have made in 
          laying the foundation of this Settlement. I most humbly 
          thank their Ldsps. for the good offices they intend me, and 
          herewith I send you an honest account of my disbursemts., 
          so farr as I conceive they are for publique service, and I 
          chearfully submit it to my Lords how farr they are soe ; As to 
          the part respecting the Indians it is unavoydable, and if their 
          Lordships will be pleased to look over my 23rd Instruction 
          etc., it will appear how much reason I had to bestow somewhat 
          upon these people, and yt. Instruction has farther encouraged 
          me to promise that if by their behaviour, they deserved it, H.M. 
          would order them some small presents, in blankits, corn, small 
          shot and powder for their hunting ; they are now expecting 
          them and it will be quite impossible for me not to give some- 
          thing, I hope my Lords will recomend it ; two hundred 
          pds. pr. year, until the quit-rent and the other penny to defray 
          the province charges commences, will be sufficient, wch. sum 
          must mostly be layd out in blankets, powder, swan, goose and
          duck shot, laced hatts of about 10s. sterl. each, and some flints 
          from London. As for travelling charges for me and my 
          Deputys, I believe it is usual for all rideing officers, some of 
          them are very rarely long in a place, and it is not easy to imagine 
          the expence they are at and the fateague of travelling in this 
          country, they are all in debt and cannot attend this duty without 
          some addition, or travelling charges, in my humble opinion 
          fifty pounds pr. ann. added to each of them in lieu of travelling 
          charges would be a less expence than to pay them pr. diem. 
          I will allways keep them full imployed ; I submit my own 
          expences to my Lords' recommendation, and hope they will allow 
          that I have not been idle ; the sum I charge for sloop hire and 
          men and victuals is all payd and charged to me, it was impossible 
          without it to give any description of ye parts which I have 
          done in my letters ; I formerly proposed that if 200£. was 
          allowed me I would build a proper coasting sloop, and would 
          maintain her for so much pr. ann. ; this would enable me to 
          view ye coast and rivers, prevent any abuses, and go any where 
          on H.M. service. As for the other articles in my account, I 
          found it quite impracticable to lay any foundation for a settle- 
          ment, without some cover and security for the people, and 
          therefore raised a dry stone wall 4 1/2 feet thick, upon ye ruins 
          of ye old fort, wch. also commands a fine harbour, and protects 
          vessels against any insult from the Indians, or other enemy, 
          and so by degrees I was insensibly drawn into this expence. 
          Any part of it that will be ordered me, I shall thankfully receive 
          as so much given, and if any is deducted I hope it will be allowed 
          out of the quit rents when they become due ; and were I not 
          under incumbrances here upon account of those expences I 
          would be well contented to be payd out of ye quit rents etc. 
          As for the publique advantages accrueing hereby I have onely 
          this to say, that if recovering a fine and a vast country from a 
          wilderness and planting an usefull Collony there, raiseing a 
          small fortification with the King's flag, a few ship guns, small 
          armes and ammunition, and putting it in a posture of defence, 
          and by inconsiderable presents reconcileing the savages to 
          receive H.M. subjects with good will and friendship, instead 
          of forceing them at an expence of blood and mony, or letting 
          it remain a wilderness for ever, if this be not deemed to be of 
          publique use and advantage is most humbly submitted to my 
          superiors. It is now the 18th of June, 4 days ago Major Cosby 
          arrived here with an Officer, serjt. and drummer and twenty 
          men from Governour Philips's regt. from Canso. I wrote to 
          the Governour in September last pursuant to my Instructions 
          to send me 30 men, upon apprehensions that the Indians would 
          give us some uneasyness being incited thereunto, but I hope 
          nothing will persuade them to it ; if there had been occasion 
          it appears by this how impracticable it is to depend upon any 
          assistance from Nova Scotia. The Officer and his men are well 
          lodged within the fort, and brought their provisions and 
          ammunition with them. My letters are generally so very long 
          that I fear it prevents their being taken into consideration. 
          I have no other pleasure in writeing, but as I think it my duty, 
          and I am really not able to do it according to my Comn. 
          and Instructions to correspond with ye other Offices. I am 
          frequently troubled with a little of the palsy, and cannot afford 
          to keep any Clerk or Assistant, nor indeed to live myself, upon 
          my present income in my ordinary expences etc. Continues :

          sent home etc. I have given security to prosecute ye appeals

          that you will recommend this to my Lords and that you will 
          watch an opertunity at their leisure to lay this long epistle before 
          their Lordships with my most humble duty and thanks for all 
          their favours, which as I am going to New Hampshire I shall 
          take another oppertunity to do from thence. P.S. I hope 
          by the honour I have of being a sub to Mr. Belcher in the Lt. 
          Governour's Commission of N. Hampshire, it is not intended

          Governor Hunter to the Duke of Newcastle. Since 
          my last, of which herewith goes a duplicate, there has nothing 
          fallen out extraordinary <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">here</placeName>. The Genll. Assembly was 
          adjourn'd at their own request for a fortnight on account of 
          the Supream Court. They are to meet again on Tuesday next. 
          Encloses Address etc., " which contains fair promises. I shall 
          not answer for the performances. Something may be done 
          in the affair of the quit rents : They have resolved to subsist 
          the two regiments for six months more. They are all at their 
          several quarters, those in the country have suffered least being 
          farther from rum than these in the towns, and generally speaking 
          the whole well barrackt or lodg'd. The inclosed petition etc. 
          was this day given me by the Chief Justice and the other Judges 
          etc. The girl said nothing in her own defence on her tryal, 
          but after sentence, the matter appear'd so plain, that the Bench 
          ordered the woman to be prosecuted for perjury and recom- 
          mended the unhappy young woman as an object of H.M. mercy, 
          and I am an humble suitor to your Grace that her pardon may 
          be granted etc. When the Session is over I shall inform your 
          Grace more particularly of affairs etc. Signed, Ro. Hunter.

          recommended, they have come to resolutions for 
          strengthning and securing the island and restoring 
          its credit ; introducing white settlers, and rendering 
          white servants more useful by a more speedy method 
          for the recovery of their wages ; for better regulating 
          the retailing of rum ; the making good all deficient 
          funds ; and the better securing and more speedy 
          collecting H.M. quit-rents etc. We shall not be

          for the murder of her bastard child. She said nothing 
          in her defence, being afraid of prejudicing in her 
          business, her mistress, the first witness at her trial, 
          who is a school-mistress and has maintained and 
          employed her ever since her parents died when she 
          was very young, if it should become known that she 
          was acquainted with her being with child and with 
          her delivery, petitioner little doubting but that her 
          mistress as she often promised would on her trial set 
          forth the facts etc. Altho' she was not so happy to 
          be amongst people who had compassion enough to 
          listen to her crys, yet she made earnest and loud 
          complaints and three several times sent out one of 
          the scholars to call Mrs. Laugher, wch. scholar was 
          in Court ready to give her testimony, but was not 
          produced etc. Prays to be recommended for H.M.

          Same to the Duke of Newcastle. Abstract. Enclose 
          extract from Governor Montgomery's letter, 21st Dec., 1730, 
          relating to the trading house intended to be erected by the 
          French in the <placeName ref="#us_ny_iroquoia" role="direct">Sennekees' country</placeName>. His Grace is fully apprized 
          of the arts used by the French to withdraw the affections of 
          the Five Nations from the English, contrary to the intent of 
          the 15th article of the Treaty. The same consequences are to 
          be apprehended from this new trading house, as have really 
          happen'd from that erected some years ago at <placeName ref="us_ny_fortniagara" role="direct">Niagara</placeName>, which 
          is now converted into a fort, by which the French have gained 
          a possession in that place. Refer to their representations to 
          Lord Carteret on that point. The French have now taken 
          the very same steps in a country to which they have not the 
          colour of any title, and should they be permitted to go on, 
          might be of very fatal consequence to our Indian Nations, who 
          might thereby be drawn from their allegiance to H.M. etc.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Committee 
          of Privy Council. Report upon petition of Ex-Governor 
          Phenny. State case and quote Peter Goudet, Treasurer of the 
          <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">Bahamas</placeName>, that the sums raised during his administration were 
          justly applied to the service of the public, and accounted for 
          to the Assembly. The Assembly's objections appear to relate 
          solely to the legality of the method by which the mony was 
          levied. There was no assembly constituted during his 
          government, so that the money was raised by the highest 
          authority which then subsisted, and by the same power as his 
          predecessor had levied taxes for the same purposes. Continue : 
          We think Mr. Phenny's proceeding to be very justifiable 
          from that part of his Commission whereby he was authorized 
          to do everything that might conduce to the security of his 
          Government, the good of the people, and the honour of the 
          Crown. Acts of this kind have their foundation in reason, and
          are vindicated from their own necessity, as well as by the 
          practice of England towards infant Colonies. It may be further 
          alledged in Mr. Phenney's favour, that the aforesaid levies were 
          approved at the Quarter Sessions of the Island, which was the 
          most popular Court that could take cognizance of such matters, 
          before the constitution of the Assembly and the people of the 
          Bahamas did concur in several addresses to Mr. Phenney, 
          approving his whole conduct. It would be a very great hardship 
          therefore if he should be obliged to stand the event of a suit 
          at law in the Bahamas upon the abovementioned bond ; and 
          we have no objection why H.M. may not be graciously pleased 
          to order his Governor to deliver the said bond to Mr. Phenney's 
          Attorney, in order to be cancelled. With respect to the sloops 
          fitted out by Mr. Phenney, to fetch provisions for the garrison 
          at the Bahamas, altho' he may have been a considerable sufferer 
          by their being cast away in their return to those islands, yet 
          as it does not appear to us that he had any orders for that 
          equipment ; we can only submit this article, together with that 
          of the fortifications, upon which Mr. Phenney appears to have 
          taken a great deal of pains, to H.M. goodness and compassion.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. It 
          having been lately represented to us, that inconveniences may 
          arise from the devolution of Government in the <placeName ref="#leeward" role="direct">Leeward Islands</placeName> 
          as it is at present setled by your Majesty's Commission etc., 
          whereby it is directed, that in the absence of the Capt. General 
          the chief command shall devolve upon the Lieut. General, and 
          in his absence, upon the Lieut. Govr. of <placeName ref="#nevis" role="direct">Nevis</placeName> and upon the 
          President of the Council in that Island, in the absence of the 
          Lieut. Governor. In all probability, the first cause of giving 
          this preference to Nevis, was, it's having been entirely settled 
          before any other of the Leeward Islands ; but as <placeName ref="#stchristophers" role="direct">St. Christophers</placeName> 
          and <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> are now become much more considerable, the 
          reason of that preference ceases, and we most humbly offer to 
          your Majesty, that for the future the chief command in these 
          islands shall, in the absence of the Capt. General and Lieut. 
          General, devolve upon the eldest Lieut. Governor being resident 
          in any of the four islands, according to the priority of their 
          commissions of Lt. Governor. We are induced to recommend 
          the Lieut. Govrs. preferrably to the Presidents of the several 
          Councils, because the former have the honour to bear your 
          Majesty's commission, and generally speaking are persons of 
          greater consequence, and better acquainted with the nature 
          and methods of command and authority ; But if it should 
          happen that neither the Governor in Chief, the Lieut. General 
          nor any of the Lieut. Govrs. should be resident in the islands, 
          we could humbly propose in that case that the chief 
          command should devolve upon the President of the Council 
          of St. Christophers, and the reason why we give preference 
          to this island is, that it was first discovered and planted by the 
          English in conjunction with the French, and had it not been 
          for that partition it would probably have been first named 
          in the Govrs' commission ; but the French part having been 
          surrendred to <placeName ref="#gb" role="descriptive">Gt. Britain</placeName> etc., it is now entirely settled by 
          your Majesty's subjects, and is become equal to, if not 
          of greater consequence than any other of the Leeward 
          Islands. The Governmt. of the Leeward Islands is now 
          devolv'd upon the President of ye Council of Nevis, and 
          we should have proposed this alteration sooner, had there ever 
          been any probability that this would have happen'd. If 
          your Majesty shall be pleased to approve of this alteration, 
          we take leave humbly to propose that it may be made in ye 
          draught of the Commission lately prepared for Col. Cosby.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. In 
          reply to 10th March, quote their letter to Govr. Belcher of 
          12th Dec. Continue : Since that time, we have reced. 
          letters from him, in which he acquaints us, that notwithstanding 
          he had formerly had, of ye next Assembly's acting more suitably 
          to your Majesty's Instructions, yet he found they would not 
          go beyond what had been settled in ye foregoing session, and 
          he was sorry to acquaint us, that ye new Assembly <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">[[ed. of Massachusetts]]</placeName>
          had gon backward, and seem'd to do nothing more than had been done 
          about forty years ago, when their present form of Government 
          was first established. Upon this, we beg leave to inform your 
          Majesty that by your 26th Instruction to Mr. Belcher, it is 
          declared to be yor. Majestie's express will and pleasure, that 
          he do not give his assent to any act, or order of Assembly etc. 
          for any gift to be made to him etc., except only in the manner 
          prescribed in the 27th Instruction, quoted (that he should 
          propose to the Assembly to pass a law declaring the salary of 
          their Governor for the time being to be 1000£ pr. ann. sterling). 
          Continue : By the Act referred to us, it is provided that ye 
          summ of " 2400£. shou'd be paid out of ye publick Treasury to 
          Jonathan Belcher Esq., etc. for ye present, as an ample and 
          honble. support, and suitable to ye dignity of his station." 
          Likewise, " That at ye beginning of ye next ensuing May 
          session, another Act should pass, for an ample and honourable 
          support to ye sd. Governor Belcher, which shou'd be annually 
          renew'd at ye beginning of every May session during his 
          government and residence in that Province," etc. In our opinion 
          the 2,400£. thereby intended to be given to the Governor is 
          contrary to his 26th Instruction, and the provision thereby 
          intended to be made, that at ye beginning of the next ensuing 
          May session another Act should pass, for an ample and honour- 
          able support to Governor Belcher, which should be annually 
          renewed etc., does, by no means come up to his 27th Instruction, 
          but seems rather calculated to leave the Govr. still dependent 
          upon ye Assembly for his support, and we are at a loss to imagine 
          how Mr. Belcher in his letter to the Duke of Newcastle could 
          think that this might be taken as a settlemt. during his 
          Governmt. [C.O. 5, 916. pp. 415-418.]</p>

          Colebrooke's obstruction in the matter of the fortifica- 
          tions etc. Continues : Having at several other times bred 
          disturbances between me and the inhabitants and also 
          encouraged the soldiers of the garrison to mutiny here 
          and make unjust complaints at home, he was the last 
          Sessions indicted by the Grand Jury and also tryed and 
          found guilty by a Petty Jury for baratry etc. Will soon 
          transmit the whole proceedings. Continues : Mr. Colebrooke 
          is now proceeding to appeal. I am extremely concern'd that 
          there was a necessity for so much rigour and that if he had 
          been suffer'd to continue his evil practices H.M. might have 
          had a much worse account and perhaps riskt or lost the Colony, 
          shou'd either our neighbours the Spaniards or Pirates have any 
          view to surprize us during our dissentions occasioned by this 
          man, for here has been more contention lately than I knew 
          even whilst I was last here amongst the pirates. And I hope 
          this example will prevent anything like it for the future etc.

          Governor Belcher to Duke of Newcastle. His 
          former letters and the Journal of the Representatives enclosed 
          must make it clear that there is no prospect of anything being 
          done conformable to H.M. Instruction as to fixing a salary. 
          Continues : I am, My Lord Duke, perfectly devoted to H.M. 
          service and honour, and the interest of His British Dominions 
          and these I think not only consistent with but a strengthning 
          of the prosperity of his Plantations, and after this way of 
          thinking I have conducted the administration of the King's 
          Government <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">here</placeName>. And before the year comes about I shall 
          have spent more than the King has required for the support of 
          his Govr., and yet have hardly been able to live as necessarily 
          becomes H.M. Govr. I wou'd therefore with great submission 
          repeat to your Grace that upon a sedate and reasonable review 
          of this matter I can't believe it will be thought justice to me 
          or for the King's honour that I must imploy my life in the 
          King's service and that of his subjects here, to the continual 
          consumption of my own estate, without the least support from 
          the Crown, or from the people here. Yet this has been and is 
          my hard case. I would therefore pray, My Lord Duke, that 
          I may have H.M. leave to sign the inclosed bill etc. (v. 26th 
          April, No. 157 i.) for my support, which your Grace must believe 
          will strengthen me in the service of the Crown, and it will be a 
          punishment upon the people to take their money, " for they 
          really smile at the late Govr's spending 1000£. sterl. of his 
          own estate without receiving a farthing from them " etc. 
          Quotes cases of Lord Bellamont and Mr. Dudley. Concludes : 
          I suppose the great affairs of <placeName ref="#europe" role="secondary">Europe</placeName> have continually ingrost 
          your Grace, and prevent me any answer to the many letters 
          I have wrote etc., yet even this, My Lord Duke, makes this 
          Assembly imagine the King has given over the affair of the 27th Instruction, etc.

          Address of the Council and Representatives of
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts Bay</placeName> to the King. 
          We, your Majesty's loyal and dutiful subjects, in great submission to your Majesty, as 
          well as faithfulness to your subjects of this Province, humbly 
          implore your Majesty's indulgence, and compassionate ear, 
          while we lay before your Majesty our great difficulty by reason 
          of your 27th Instruction to your Governour. We account it 
          our greatest honour, and it is our highest joy, that in the compass 
          of your Majesty's extensive Dominions, none are more firmly 
          and zealously attacht to your Majesties person, and the august 
          House of Hannover, than the whole body of this people : and 
          as we are universally fixed in the principles of loyalty and 
          obedience, and our hearts and affections strongly engaged to 
          your Majesty, by the repeated instances of your paternal care 
          and tenderness towards us ; so particularly by your Majesties 
          distinguishing goodness to this Province, in the appointment 
          of your Majestie's present Governor, and being sincerely desirous 
          to enable and encourage your Majesty's Governour, chearfully to 
          manage the public affairs, your Majesties Council and the House 
          of Representatives, soon after his arival pass'd a bill for his 
          ample and honorable support, and again at the beginning of 
          the present session, they have offered the sum of 5,400£., which 
          sum he has declined accepting on account of your Majesties' 
          Instruction, directing the settlement of a salary on the 
          Governor ; which Instruction, in faithfulness to the rights 
          and privileges of your Majestie's subjects here, we cannot comply 
          with, inasmuch as it would in a great measure alter, if not 
          subvert our happy constitution, wherein it is designed that 
          every part of the Legislature should be induced by interest, 
          as well as duty, to consult an harmony with the others : And 
          we beg leave to observe that the Council, and Representatives 
          have a great dependance on the Governor in many particulars 
          nearly affecting their interest, and that the Governor is under 
          little, or no inducement, as to interest to cultivate a good 
          understanding with them, more especially the House of Repre- 
          sentatives, except that of their granting his support. And 
          while your Majestie's Governor refuses to accept of anything, 
          unless in the way of a fixed salary, and your subjects here, for 
          the reason aforesaid, cannot come into such settlement, the 
          Governor must needs be a sufferer for want of a decent and 
          honorable support. We would therefore most humbly intreat 
          your Majesty, to grant your royal order of leave, that your 
          Governor may receive the sum that has already bin granted, 
          and such further sums as may be granted for his honorable 
          support, suitable to the dignity of his station, when he shall 
          judge them to be so ; which we doubt not this, and all 
          succeeding Assemblys will readily come into, and should they not, 
          we acknowledge your Majesty will have just reason to show your 
          displeasure. Your Majestie's dutiful Council, and Represen- 
          tatives would also humbly beg leave to set forth the great 
          difficulties arising from your Majestie's 30th. Instruction, 
          whereby, should it be comply'd with, the House of Represent- 
          atives would be hindered from passing on those accompts, which 
          they humbly apprehend they have a good right unto, in 
          conjunction with the other branches of the Legislature ; 
          and this is very consistent with the Royal Charter, forasmuch 
          as the Governor, by warrant, with the advice and consent 
          of your Majestie's Council, thereupon issues the money out of 
          the Treasury, which the House of Representatives never pre- 
          tended to intermeddle with, but always supposed, that this 
          of right belonged to your Majestie's Governour and Council, 
          by the Royal Charter, nor has any money ever been drawn 
          out otherwise ; and should this instruction take effect, the 
          House of Representatives, who raise the public money, and 
          whose constituents pay it, would not in many cases, be in any 
          capacity to prevent misapplications of the money, or of 
          obtaining any redress upon undue payments, which it is humbly 
          conceived, would be against common right and equity; for 
          the direction as to a future examination, can serve only to 
          aggravate our distress, but noways helps to refund the money, 
          or gain any relief : there being no possibility of impeachment 
          here, as there is in such cases, in <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">our Mother Countrey</placeName>,  
          before the Right Honorable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in

          Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Since my last (of which you have duplicate here- 
          with) several ships are arriv'd from <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName> without a letter 
          from your Lordships except a few lines purely in favour of the 
          bearer Mr. Reynolds, son to my Lord Bishop of <placeName ref="#en_lincoln" role="descriptive">Lincoln</placeName>, who 
          not finding the collection of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">N. Hampshire</placeName> to answer his 
          expectations returns by this conveyance. Had he remained, 
          I should have given him all the assistance in my power etc. 
          Continues : H.M. Council and House of Representatives <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">[[ed. of Massachusetts]]</placeName>
          send to their Agents by this conveyance the bill they have past for 
          my support, with their Address to H.M. that I may have leave 
          to take it, and they think they have made a great step, inasmuch 
          as the bill they have now past is after the rate of 3000£ a year 
          from my arrival etc., whereas they us'd to give Govr. Shute 
          no more than 1000£ a year and that was voted only half yearly. 
          I am really of opinion they will not give less for the future, 
          and that they'll do it at the beginning of the year which practice 
          will make the Govr. independent from year to year. Let that 
          be as it will I don't suppose H.M. will withdraw his Instruction 
          etc. Yet I can't see the reason, justice or honour of his Govr. 
          being starv'd or consuming his own substance while he is 
          defending the cause of the Crown etc. Hopes for the royal 
          leave to take his support as the Assembly will give it etc. 
          Continues : As to the 30th Instruction I cannot think it 
          consistent with the King's honour to part with the power 
          reserv'd to the Crown in the Royal Charter, and I really think 
          in that article the House of Representatives thirst after a 
          power that by no means belongs to them, and cou'd they come 
          at it, it wou'd give them such an overbalance of power as 
          wou'd greatly weaken the just authority of H.M. Govr. and 
          Council, and tend to the destruction of the present happy 
          constitution of H.M. Government here. I, therefore, hope 
          your Lordship[s] will rightly represent this matter and prevent 
          the mischief that might be consequent upon their obtaining 
          what they aim at. In my next I shall give my reasons more 
          at large against the House of Representatives having anything 
          to do with passing or paying accompts. The Charter certainly 
          intends that matter shou'd always be with the Govr. and 
          Council. Signed, J. Belcher. Endorsed, Recd. 27th July,

          Same to Mr. Popple. Abstract. Acknowledges letters 
          of 24th Feb. and 5th April, with the opinion of the Attorney 
          and Solicitor General on fines and recoveries, which he will 
          communicate, as there shall be occasion, " though I hardly 
          know an instance of any such things being attempted in their 
          Government." Repeats complaint that he has not heard 
          from the Board, which makes the Assembly imagine that the 
          affair of the 27th Instruction is over etc. Repeats part of 
          preceding, the expense of his voyage, commission and 
          supporting the King's honour <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">here</placeName> to make it necessary that 
          he should be allowed to accept the Assembly's allowance. 
          Concludes : The appointment of the new Lieut. Governor of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">N. Hampshire</placeName> after his so vilely traducing me, has been a 
          great weakning of the King's authority in my hands, nor do I

          relating to the rebellious negroes and the two Regiments. 
          (a) Col. Thomas Townshend to Mr. Walmesley, late Agent 
          to Br. Newton. Port Royal, 12th Feb., 1731. Three companys of ours, 
          and three of Col. Hayes's are embarked for <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, 
          where it has been said the runaway negroes have been troublesome, 
          altho' I do not find so much in that, as has been reported, 
          and if it were, as they have 120 miles of mountains to range 
          in, it seems very impracticable to destroy them, the people 
          do not seem to value them, nor do they for the most part seem 
          well pleased at our comeing.</p>

          <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName>, 14th Feb., 1731.
          After 7 weeks passage from <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">Gibraltar</placeName>, 
          we arrived here the 7th etc., the regiment in very good health, 
          but begin now to be very sickly. No oven sure was ever so 
          hot. I find it affects my eyes very much, and still have the 
          gravel very much, and my legs swell. We have yet only 14 
          companies landed etc., for I find we are an unexpected guest. 
          The affair of the Blacks I took upon to be quite a Bam, for I 
          can find nobody that has either seen or felt them in a wrathfull 
          manner ; we shall very soon be dispersed about <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Island</placeName>, 
          not a company together, after that I know no business I have 
          here except to sacrifice my health and impoverish my fortune, 
          for realy twice my income will not maintain me as a Collo. 
          ought to live, and I have only the same allowance here as an 
          Ensign which is 20s. pr. week.</p>

        <p>(c) Col. Townsend to Col. Cope. 2nd March, 1731. The 
          accommodations of the two Regiments here, I am affraid will 
          not be very good : at our landing no manner of provision had 
          been made, for I cannot find that anyone expected us, and I 
          am very sure that at present there is no occasion for us : the 
          affair of the rebellious negroes is a triffle, they have force 
          sufficient of their own twenty times told, to put an end to that 
          whenever they have a mind to exert themselves ; nor have 
          they ever been known to appear fifty together in armes etc. 
          In the mean time we are a burthen to <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Island</placeName> of about 
          15,000£ a year etc. Both regiments are at present ill of feavers 
          and fluxes ; I expect to have bad account of them within these 
          3 months etc. Everything here is excessive dear, twice dearer 
          than at <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">Gibraltar</placeName>, no species of money less in value than a 
          royale of plate, which is prodigious hardship upon the soldiers.
          (d) Same to Mr. Walmesley. 3rd March, 1731. To same 
          effect as preceding.</p>

        <p>(e) Col. St. Cornwallis to Lord Cornwallis. 5th March, 1731. 
          Most part of the regiment will be dispersed about <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the country</placeName> 
          in many places where there never was a rebellious negro ever 
          heard of, so that two regiments here are no more wanted, except 
          they have a mind to make planters of us, (especially since we are 
          so well with <placeName ref="#es" role="secondary">Spain</placeName>), which I believe some of them have hopes 
          off, for most of them say they are glad we are come because they 
          want white people and not for fear of the blacks, for no one 
          pretends to say that thirty of them were ever seen together etc. 
          This is the most expensive disagreeable place under the sun etc. 
          Our people begin now to be sickly, tho' 'tis at present the 
          healthiest time reckoned etc. Regrets that so many young men 
          should have been sent, when the people were surprized at their 
          coming, and there is now nothing for them to do etc. The 
          troops to be sent to <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName> are forced to live still upon 
          last provision, for there is at present neither provision or 
          lodging for them, so they keep on board the ships still etc. 
          Concludes : I fancy if you mention this to some of my friends 
          one may have a chance to come home, etc. ; if we stay, they 
          must provide better, but by that time perhaps above half may be dead.</p>

        <p>(f) Same to Same. 10th March, 1731. We have buried the 
          Major of our regiment, and I fear every account will be worse 
          and worse etc. for our men are sent to the quarters in the county, 
          before they have provided barracks etc. Within these two days 
          the inhabitants of the two towns have petitioned to have two 
          companys each, paying their lodging themselves, else they 
          would have been dispersed in like manner. In short the upper 
          sort of people of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this island</placeName> are such brutes, and the Governour 
          so mild, that we shall suffer most terribly, for as the majority 
          of the last Assembly did everything to vex him, we are sadly 
          used by that means, for they have taken from him the power 
          of quartering the King's troops as they ought to be, for he says 
          he could not help it, and that the Assembly would do it in 
          spight of his teeth etc. We have an account from the party 
          that was sent after the negroes, who say they went to
          <placeName ref="#jm_nannytown" role="direct">their settlement</placeName>, and fought several hours,
          and have burnt their town, but in this terrible engagement they have neither killed 
          nor taken any one of the negroes, so presume those they pretend 
          to have fought with so long were men in buckram etc.</p>

          pistole here etc. I shall think myself well off if this expedition 
          costs me only 1000£. extraordinary : I have taken a little house 
          here at a place called <placeName ref="#jm_liguanea" role="direct">Ligony</placeName>, the pleasantest part of the island, 
          but no better than an English barn which I am obliged to pay 
          200£. a year ; for my cook, which is a very indifft. one 50£. ;

          but think it very fit that it should take it's rise from the Royal 
          authority wch. first gave being to the form of Government 
          established in New Jersey, and not from the Assembly of that 
          Province. In this Act likewise the suspending clause is omitted, 
          and therefore we humbly lay it before your Majesty, together 
          with the two first, for your disapprobation, all of them having 
          been passed contrary to the Governor's Instructions, the two 
          first being destructive of the jurisdiction of the law courts in 
          New Jersey, and the last of a nature too much encroaching 
          upon the Prerogative of the Crown. [C.O. 5, 996. pp. 270-273.]</p>

          An act of Assembly, 1726, for laying duties on liquors imported, was continued by another 
          act in 1730 till June, 1734. By a clause in the last act no more 
          than half the duty is to be paid for any liquors imported in any 
          ship or vessel wholly and solely belonging to the inhabitants 
          of the said Colony. This clause is not part of the Act of 1726, 
          and such exemption is a very partial proceeding, and is assuming 
          a power of taxing H.M. subjects at large to a higher degree 
          than themselves etc., and a setting up the shipping of that 
          Colony in opposition to, and in great prejudice of the Navigation 
          of this Kingdom, etc. Pray for repeal of latter act, and that 
          the Governor may be restrained from passing any act laying 
          any higher duty on the goods 'or ships of H.M. subjects residing 
          in this Kingdom, than on those belonging to inhabitants of the said Colony.

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. As 
          the French in this part of the world seem very intent in making 
          new settlements, I think it my duty to give your Grace an 
          account of the French which have settled at <placeName ref="#lc" role="direct">St. Lucia</placeName> as well 
          as of the English ; By the common computation there are 
          supposed to be three hundred French familys. I can't learn 
          there are above five or six English, it is also computed there's 
          as many French at <placeName ref="#dm" role="direct">Dominico</placeName>, 
          and a great many at <placeName ref="#stvincent" role="direct">St. Vincent's</placeName>, 
          both English and French imploy themselves in raising of stock, 
          sowing corn, and cuting timber ; I don't find that the French 
          have any grant for the land that they take up, but the Governour 
          of <placeName ref="#mq" role="direct">Martinique</placeName> gives them leave to go thither to cut timber 
          and fish, and as they clear away the ground they plant it with 
          corn, and breed great quantities of stock, two or three of the 
          French familys have taken up a great deal of land, and are 
          grown rich ; one or two I am informed applyed to the Governor 
          of Martinique for leave to plant canes, and erect cattle mills 
          to make sugar, but he would not grant it ; the few English 
          that are settled at Sta. Lucia took up the land which they 
          thought convenient for them, and clear the timber which they 
          bring hither for sale and plant corn, and provision to support 
          their negroes which they keep there, as well as for sale here, 
          I know not any of them have any grant or permission from the 
          Duke of Montague, one of them Mr. Batt built a small vessell 
          of about fifteen tons, and applyed to me for a register etc. 
          Refers to former letter. Continues : I have been informed that 
          the Governour of Martinique some times talks of removeing 
          the English from off that Island. On the <placeName ref="#tobago" role="direct">Island of Tobago</placeName> 
          there are no French familys yet settled, but the French go thither 
          to catch turtle, and whilst they stay there make huts to live in, 
          during the time of their fishing, the intention of the French 
          seems to be to people these islands gradually, and as they can 
          live much more hardy then the English, are more able to make 
          such settlements, than they. In November last I advised your 
          Grace that a French guardecote of Martinique had taken some 
          English vessells at Sta. Lucia etc. Encloses the Governor's 
          reply to his letter (encl. i). As the Assembly in their Minutes 
          of 13th Feb. last, mention that I had demanded of them 2000£. 
          and upwards for the pretended repairs of <placeName ref="#bb_governmenthouse" role="direct">Pilgrims House</placeName> 
          I herewith transmit to your Grace their Addresses to me upon 
          that head, by the first of which your Grace will observe that 
          they desired me to lay before them, an account of the charges 
          of the repairs of Pilgrim House which I did in Nov. 1724, and 
          after they had examined the accounts and receipts they 
          addressed me 11th of May 1725 in these words, " It appearing 
          to us that your Excellency has laid out, paid, and expended 
          the sum of 2070£. 14s. 1d., current money in and about the 
          necessary repairs of Pilgrim House and buildings " etc. The 
          Assembly mention in the same Minutes that there was but 87 
          barrels of powder in the great Magazine tho' there were wont to 
          be 800. I have transmitted to your Grace their address to me 
          the 12th day of October 1725 by which your Grace will observe, 
          that on account of the ruinous condition of the old magazine, 
          they desire me to appoint a proper place or places for the keeping 
          the said powder, and stores, till the Magazine should be repair'd, 
          or a new one erected, and accordingly I order'd it to be remov'd 
          into the several forts, but I do not so much wonder at this 
          proceeding since they say in the same Minutes that they know 
          that I opposed their Sugar bill at the Board for Trade and that 
          Mr. Sharpe my Agent opposed the same, my letter to your 
          Grace as well as the Board for Trade will justify my conduct 
          upon this head, and as to Mr. Sharpe's opposing the same tis 
          now notoriously known that their Agents in <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName> first 
          employed him, and then dismissed him by orders from hence, 
          and <placeName ref="#ie" role="secondary">Ireland</placeName> and the other Colonies immediately retain'd him. 
          The Council here some time since were very much exasperated 
          at the treatment they met with from the Assembly, who called 
          them incendiaries, and it might have been carried to great 
          lengths had I not kept my temper, and conducted it calmly, 
          but at present <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">the Island</placeName> is very quiet, etc.

        <p>Findings of the Admiralty Court, <placeName ref="#mq" role="direct">Martinique</placeName>, (i) 
          The English bark Anne of Dartmouth (Capt. Shepheard) 
          was released with costs and damages from day of 
          seizure, it being proved that she had loaded and 
          cleared from <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">Barbados</placeName> and had only been 8 hours at 
          anchor at <placeName ref="#lc" role="direct">Sta. Lucia</placeName>, (ii) The bark Jeanne Marie 
          d'Amboye was released, with costs and damages 
          against the Domaine. The master had no papers 
          to prove that he had really loaded at the island of 
          Iscap [sic], so that it appears he was generously treated 
          on the assumption that he had been forced to put in 
          at Sta. Lucia, (iii) The bark Two Brothers had no 
          papers on board and was condemned and confiscated 
          with her boat for trading at Sta. Lucia, her crew having 
          been rowing a boat laden with a keg of brandy, (iv) 
          The Good Intention was likewise confiscated, it being 
          proved that she had come from Barbados in ballast 
          and being found laden with produce of the French 
          islands, (v) The Fortune was confiscated, for having 
          no papers and trading at Sta. Lucia, being laden with 
          goods admitted by the Captain, Isaac Royal, he had 
          taken off Sta. Lucia. Copy. French. 1 1/2 pp.</p>

          is cleared out for <placeName ref="#bm" role="indirect">Bermuda</placeName> to prevent my sending any letters

          or prevail on those of the party he has made here, to joyn in, 
          by way of complaint against me, I find there is a necessity for 
          my taking the liberty of directing this packet to you, for a 
          further security of its being conveyed and delivered, which I 
          hope you will be pleased to excuse. The prosecuting Mr. 
          Colebrooke I humbly hope will be approved, and convince 
          the Ministry what a mischievous person he has been, and how 
          much he has obstructed the welfare and peopling of <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Colony</placeName>. 
          For my part, I assure you, Sir, I never had so much uneasiness 
          in my life as he has occasion'd me here ; for instead of applying 
          himself to the improvemt. and encouragemt. of trade (which 
          was what he came abroad for) he together with four or five 
          more who were his companions and dependents made it their 
          whole study to injure and distress me by continually 
          endeavouring to stirr up sedition and animosity in the minds 
          of the people, and discontent and mutiny in the garrison which 
          he attempted by all the methods he could think on etc. Requests 
          that he may be given time to answer any misrepresentations

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Governor Rogers. 
          Acknowledge letters etc. of Oct. and Feb. 10th last. Have 
          referred the acts enclosed to Mr. Fane and will take them into 
          consideration on receiving his report. Referring to Capt. 
          Phenney's bond (v. Feb. 10th and June 9th), " we are of opinion 
          that the Assembly should not have put him under so great a 
          difficulty, and therefore we have propos'd to H.M. that this 
          bond should be cancelled." Continue : We observe by the 
          Minutes of Assembly of 1st Oct. last, that upon a message 
          from them, desiring that the Council books may be laid before 
          the Assembly, you gave directions accordingly. Upon this 
          occasion, we must observe to you, that as by your Instructions 
          all laws to be pass'd by you are required to be consistent with, 
          and as near as may be consonant to the laws of this Kingdom ; 
          so it would be proper that the proceedings of the Assembly 
          also should resemble those of the Parliament of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>, 
          so far as the circumstances of <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">the Colony</placeName> and your Instructions 
          will permit. And as the Council with you as in all ye other 
          Colonies abroad have two capacitys very different in their 
          nature, and design, so their proceedings as the King's Council 
          in political matters should be kept entirely distinct from those 
          wherein they act as one branch of the Legislature, and ought 
          to be fairly entered in separate books. It would be a pretty 
          difficult task to lay down a plan for the proceedings of your 
          Assembly in future times, or to allot the particular limits to be 
          observed by them. But in general we may observe to you 
          that the Constitution of <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> owes its preservation very 
          much to the maintaining of an equal ballance between the three 
          branches of the Legislature, and that the more distinct they 
          are kept from each other, the likelier they will be to agree, 
          and the longer they will be likely to last. By the Minutes of 
          the sixth of the same month, we find the Assembly desir'd 
          Capt. Phenney's Instructions might be laid before them ; But 
          as the Instructions, which H.M. thinks proper to give to his 
          Governors, are only for their conduct and guidance, you will 
          be the proper judge which of them, and when they ought 
          to be communicated to the Assembly. By the Minutes of 12th 
          May, 1730, the Assembly seems to have been prorogued by the 
          Governor and Council, but as this does not appear to be the 
          case by the Minutes of Council of the same date, you must 
          take care to have this amended in the Journals of the Assembly, 
          and the rather because the Council cannot claim any right of 
          proroguing the Assembly, and altho' this is a mistake, yet some 
          time or other, if not corrected, it may be made a precedent 
          to claim a power never yet granted to any of H.M. Councils 
          abroad. We have consider'd what you write concerning Mr. 
          White and Mr. Jenner, the former of which you have 
          suspended from his seat in Council. Upon this occasion, 
          we must take notice that you did very wrong to desire any 
          Member of the Council to retire at a time that you had some- 
          thing to propose to the remaining Members, for everyone of 
          the Council has an undoubted right to sit and debate at that 
          Board, until H.M. shall think fit to displace him from thence, 
          or he be suspended for sufficient reasons, in the manner 
          prescribed by your Instructions ; and if after this usage, Mr. 
          White has thought himself so much slighted, as to refuse to 
          return to the Council, when you sent for him, we do not think 
          this is a sufficient reason for suspending him. [C.O. 24, 1. pp. 201-206.]</p>

        <p>Case of Francis Williams of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName>. John Williams, 
          his father, being a free negro, and by his great fidelity and 
          industry having acquired a considerable estate, he obtained 
          an act, afterwards approved by the Crown, whereby it was 
          enacted that no slave should be evidence against him, and that 
          the said John Williams should henceforth be tryed by a jury 
          according to the known laws, customs and priviledges of English- 
          men and the practise and usage of that island. John Williams 
          married with Dorothy a free negro by whom he had three 
          children all sons whom he educated in the Protestant religion 
          according to the Church of England and also gave 'em all other 
          suitable education in a liberal manner. Another act was passed 
          in Jamaica to give the like priviledges to the wife and children 
          as to John Williams etc. But by an act passed 28th March 
          for the better regulating slaves etc., severe clauses are laid on all 
          free negroes in general ; (i) That all free negroes shall in 
          default of every free negroe's appearing at the vestry of the 
          parish where he resides when thereunto summoned by a warrant 
          from any J.P. in such parish in order to having their own and 
          the names, ages and sexes of their wives children registred, 
          such free negro for the first offence is to forfeit 10£., for the 
          second 20£., and for the third his or her freedom and to be 
          transported etc., on conviction before any two Justices of the 
          Peace and three Freeholders. This clause is apprehended to 
          be very improper and too much for the Assembly to take upon 
          them to enact, as it directly takes away those libertys and 
          priviledges given the family of the Williams by the several 
          acts beforementioned etc. Besides to lodge such an extensive 
          power in any two Justices and three Freeholders is much too 
          large etc. Loss of freedom will of course carry with it loss of 
          estate, which in the family of the Williams amounts to above 
          20,000£., which is too great a temptation to have a nefarious 
          use made of this and the following clause ; (ii) That all free 
          negroes from the age of 15 to 60 shall be obliged on every 
          summons or order of every custos next magistrate collector 
          or next commanding officer in each of the parishes to appear 
          when and where directed in order to be sent out in any party 
          that shall be ordered out in pursuit of the rebellious and run- 
          away negroes, and every free negroe who shall neglect to appear 
          or refuse to go out in such party shall for the first offence be 
          committed to jail for six months without bail or mainprize, for 
          the second suffer 12 months imprisonment and for the third 
          lose his freedom. This clause is likewise thought to be in 
          contradiction to the said acts, no such penaltys being inflicted 
          on any white men, besides this clause hath no proviso in case 
          of sickness nor gives no permission for sending in their places 
          one or more hunters or woodmen properer for the service than 
          persons educated in <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName> as the free negroes are to attend 
          partys in woods and mountains almost unaccessible. It is 
          also against the said acts, and also exceeding severe not to allow 
          any bail or mainprize for a family who are in possession of 
          several acts directing they shall in all cases be tryed as Englishmen 
          and who are by all the acts of Jamaica bailable on these 
          occasions and to punish or free people with imprisonment and 
          loss of freedom for not appearing on those occasions in person 
          when it may not be in his power and when he is ready 
          to substitute one or more persons etc. is surely too hard and 
          unreasonable etc., especially as the act has no proviso for women 
          or children or such as are sick or absent, (iii) It is also enacted 
          that no free negroe shall after the 2nd April 1730 wear any 
          sword, cutlass, pistols or other arms or weapons whatsoever, 
          excepting whilst on duty on the publick service or in the service 
          of their employer under the penalty of 5£. (hunters and fowlers 
          excepted), and that no free negroe do presume to buy or indent 
          any white men under the penalty of 50£. This clause is directly 
          levelled at Mr. Francis Williams, it being notorious that no 
          free negroes wear a sword and pistols besides himself and 
          what justifies him therein is not only the largeness of his estate 
          but the liability of his being assaulted by everyone whom he 
          sues for the recovery of his own. This clause may also be a 
          temptation to ill-disposed people to spirit up the minds of their 
          ignorant slaves to assault and way-lay Mr. Williams, and it is 
          observable this law does not forbid the slaves to wear swords 
          or pistols. Why should the free negroes then be prohibited ? 
          etc. The latter part of this clause is still more extraordinary 
          etc., since by a late act passed in Jamaica every planter is 
          obliged to have one white man-servant to every 30 negroes 
          under the penalty of 26£. 10s. per annum, so that this present 
          act etc. lays every free negroe who hath a plantation under a 
          necessity of incurring the penaltys of one or other of these acts 
          etc. (iv) It is also enacted that no free Indian shall work in 
          any sort of silver or gold or keep any shop for the sale of any 
          gold wares or merchandize or the produce of this island under 
          the penalty of 50£. for every offence. This clause is also thought 
          exceeding severe, for as the laws of Jamaica always heretofore 
          indulged free negroes with buying houses and settling plan- 
          tations, so it would certainly be very hard should they be 
          now debarred selling the produce of these plantations, and 
          when that produce is converted into money should be still 
          debarred from investing that money in any goods, wares or 
          merchandizes for the further enlarging their fortunes under 
          such severe penaltys as are laid by this act. And there really 
          seems a plain intention to oppress the free negroes by comparing 
          these two last clauses together which amount to this vizt., 
          they shall have neither bought nor indented servants to save 
          paying the penalty of 26£. 10s., they shall neither buy nor sell 
          any wares or produce etc., to pay such penalty and yet they 
          must pay etc. Prays that the Act may be repealed. Endorsed,

          <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="direct">the Province</placeName>. Has acted in everything to the best of his 
          capacity. Has been entirely left to himself since he entered 
          upon the country's business and instead of help from the Council, 
          they are a weight upon him. " There has been no foolery or 
          vilany sett on foot that they are not concerned inn, which has 
          increased since John Mongomery, the Attorney General, arrived." 
          Has the whole force of his wisdom and three others to guard 
          against. If he is wanting in his report, it is owing to their 
          conduct, although he has endeavoured to serve. When he 
          mentions the Council, he does not mean all, but complains of 
          three principally, vizt., Mr. Ashe, Mr. Porter, whom he has 
          refused to screen from several prosecutions for his violent and 
          unlawful proceedings in the Court of Admiralty of which he is 
          Judge, and Mr. Smith the Chief Justice, a weak hasty young 
          man drunk from morning till night, set on work by the other 
          two and some of the managers in the Assembly. He has resigned 
          his seat at the Council Board, and is reported to be going home

        <p>Governor Burrington's Report to the Council of Trade 
          and Plantations. Abstract. He arrived 25th Feb. 
          to find <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="direct">the country</placeName> in the greatest confusion, " the 
          Government sunk so low that neither peace or order 
          subsisted, the General Court suppressed, the Council 
          set aside a year and a half, and some of the Precinct 
          Courts fallen. The Admiralty Court having no 
          restraint began to draw all manner of business there, 
          and proceeded in such an extraordinary manner as 
          occasioned a general discontent and ferment among 
          the people " etc. The Judge of that Court the chief 
          actor in running the country into disorders. The late 
          Governor being a very weak man was too easily put 
          upon rash measures that have caused so many heats 
          and divisions. Has done his best to allay them. 
          Encloses addresses by the Grand Jury to H.M. and 
          himself, gratefully acknowledging the same. Called 
          a new Assembly which sat for 5 weeks from 13th April, 
          but was then obliged to part with them, finding that 
          the longer they sat the more their heats encreased, 
          and less inclination to observe H.M. Instructions which 
          he laid before them. On H.M. 19th Instruction a bill 
          was formed for an act about fees and quit-rents. But 
          instead of complying with H.M. instructions about 
          the payment of these in Proclamation money, they 
          pretended to allow the payment in that money or bills 
          at four to one discount, but then endeavoured to reduce 
          the fees four times as low as they were before, and then 
          took advantage of a division in the Council and the 
          misbehaviour of the Chief Justice etc., so that he was 
          obliged to prorogue them. They also evaded that 
          part of the Instruction that required registering of 
          lands, which is necessary for getting H.M. rent-roll, 
          for want of which and of power in the Lords Proprietors 
          there has been great difficulty hitherto in the collecting. 
          There being no Receiver General there, the collection 
          of the revenue is like to be more difficult. It will 
          require an officer inmediately commissioned, and not 
          a Deputy as is now designed. In respect to the payment
          of quit-rents, they had ingeniously contrived 
          (under pretence of not being able to pay this year) 
          that it would be near two years before rents should be 
          paid, and then the bill added they might be paid in 
          tobacco or rice at 11s. per cwt. as an equivalent for 
          Proclamation money, tho' neither are worth near so 
          much. He could get no advice from the Council as 
          to whether any equivalent at all could be taken instead 
          of money, and now asks for H.M. directions. Money 
          " is hardly to be raised in that Government, it being
          affirmed that there has not been cash eneugh at one 
          time here to pay a year's rents, and the people have 
          another plea that the Grand Deed to the inhabitants 
          of Albemarle (the name this Government was then 
          called) in 1668, under which most part of the lands 
          are held, grants the lands to them on the same terms 
          as in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="indirect">Virginia</placeName> where the rents are paid in tobacco or 
          money at the choice of the parties, and it is submitted 
          whither it would not be a means of putting people on 
          raising tobacco and thereby increase our European 
          trade that so much wants encouragement " etc. In 
          reply to xxth Instruction recounts history of the 
          paper bills of credit. All the old bills have been called 
          in and those now subsisting are by a pretended act made 
          in Nov., 1729 after the King had purchased etc. By 
          it the bills let out at loan on land security are re-issued 
          as soon as paid in, and therefore made perpetual. For 
          want of care in the valuation of the lands mortgaged, 
          it is said there has been a great deal of fraud. 
          Compares it with the Virginia currency and  
          Proclamation money. The credit of the bills is much lower 
          than stated in the Act and is declining from the 
          breaking up of this Assembly. It is held by many 
          that the act itself is void, as being made and ratifyed 
          in the name of the Lords Proprietors when they had 
          surrendered to the Crown, and also because the 
          Government were not empowered to make such an 
          act, without a clause therein not to be of force, till 
          their assent was had etc. The present Assembly, 
          however, are of opinion that the laws made in 1729 
          are not void, or at least ought to remain in force till 
          H.M. pleasure be known therein (v. Journal, 28th April) 
          the Bills have been found so necessary in facilitating 
          payments, defraying contingent charges of the Government
          and as a medium of trade, that the destroying 
          them wholly would be a great loss to the country. In 
          obedience to Instruction xxv, sends home all the 
          laws in force. He would have had them revised, if the 
          Assembly would have done business. Some are 
          obsolete, others need alterations, but in general they are 
          a body of laws well adapted to the place etc. Forbears 
          erecting a Court of Exchequer till he sees its necessity. 
          At present there is no one capable of trying a cause in 
          one. Prays one may be sent. On enquiry into complaints 
          by and against Sir R. Everard, as directed by 
          the 41st Instruction, he was not candidly dealt by the 
          Council. At length they gave their opinion that there 
          was nothing material in the complaint against him, 
          only the words spoken against H.M., which were to be 
          proved by Collector Gale now in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, and Col. 
          Thomas Harvey some time dead. The Secretary was 
          by the unanimous opinion of the Board discharged 
          from Sir Richard's complaints against him. Mr. 
          Porter having complained against several persons for 
          an intended riot and combination to assassinate him, 
          he was promised a day for hearing, if he would draw 
          the complaint in form etc., but he having offered 
          nothing further, concludes he has dropped it. Thinks 
          there was no such riot or design intended. Has 
          received a complaint against the said Judge of the 
          Admiralty for many illegal and arbitrary proceedings 
          in that Court, praying for his suspension. This he 
          laid before the Council to be proceeded upon. Mr. 
          Porter has hitherto made no reply. He laid the XLIInd 
          Instruction before the Assembly and recommended 
          it to them in his Speech, but nothing was done by 
          them. To that part which relates to persons holding 
          greater quantities of lands than their grants express, 
          it was urged that they had a law already about 
          resurveys in such cases. Asks for a form of patents. 
          Thinks 50 acres to each person in a family too little 
          to produce much pitch and tar, because 1000 acres 
          of pine land of which 19 parts in 20 of the country 
          consists, will hardly imploy one slave, so that, if not 
          altered, this regulation will prove very detrimental to 
          the revenue. In some places there are large plains 
          called Savannas, these are boggy and as bad lands 
          as the moors in the North. The pine lands are chiefly 
          sandy barrens as improper for littage as the Savannas.
          " If people have so little land it will be a very long 
          time before all the country is settled, and if men are 
          obliged to live so near one another they must make 
          their own apparrel and hous'hould goods, because 
          they cannot raise stock to purchase them brought 
          from England. It is by breeding horses, hoggs and 
          cattle, that people without slaves gain substance here 
          at first, not by their labour. If but one half of the 
          Province is inhabited, the produce of cattle etc will 
          be but half " etc. As to any grants of land made 
          since H.M. purchase, he has been moved by the 
          Assembly to join in an address to H.M. to have them 
          all confirmed, which he declined, but promised to 
          represent the matter to the Lords of Trade fully. 
          States case. Instruction XLIII required that in all 
          future grants the quit-rents should be 4s. But the 
          people urge that they have an undoubted right by the 
          Grand Deed upon the Lords Proprietors to hold their 
          lands on the same tennure as in Virginia, which is at 
          2s. per hundred etc. If this Instruction be continued, 
          it will prevent them taking up land. In reply to 
          XLVIth Instruction, gives an account of the Courts 
          and Jurisdictions established. Desires directions as 
          to the power of Assistant Judges, a great dispute 
          having been raised by the Chief Justice and his two 
          allies in the Council, who assert that the Assistants 
          have no judicial power, but sit only as supporters. 
          In that case no gentleman will accompany the Chief 
          Justice on the Bench, and it will be erecting a single 
          Judge of the Court of Common Pleas etc. As to the 
          XLVIIth Instruction, he never heard that any officers 
          in North Carolina held places under the Proprietors 
          for life, but only during their pleasure, which are all 
          now superceeded. The Assembly have always usurped 
          power. Instances their choosing a Public Treasurer, 
          now Edward Moseley, Speaker and Manager of the 
          Assembly. Refers to debate in Journal. By the 
          Assembly in 1729 a pretended act was passed constituting 
          eleven precinct Treasurers, who were all in 
          the Assembly and as they have the disposition of the 
          publick money will be constantly chosen, which forms 
          so great a party that they can lead the Assembly as 
          they please. Is sure it will be for H.M. service and the 
          quiet of the Province that a Treasurer for this Government
          be appointed by the Lords of the Treasury. In 
          accordance with Instructions XLVIII and XIX, he 
          ordered with the assent of the Council that all fees as 
          they then stood should be received till further regu- 
          lation, but they should not be compelled to receive them 
          in Province bills unless at four for one according to 
          the estimate made of them with respect to silver in 
          the pretended act. Recounts dispute with Assembly 
          on this matter. The Assembly was prorogued to 
          6th Sept., when by a law here the biennial election 
          comes on. By the LVIth Instruction he is commanded 
          to appoint Courts of Oyer and Terminer yearly, at a 
          charge not exceeding 100£. each session. If this money 
          is to be paid in bills it will not suffice. Asks for 
          directions. As to LXIst Instruction, there is a law 
          concerning juries already, though it has certain incon- 
          veniences. The LXIIIrd Instruction he recommended 
          to the Assembly in vain. His LXIXth Instruction 
          to countenance H.M. officers he strictly obeys, though 
          it has made enemies of several of his former friends. 
          The LXXVth and LXXVIth instructions, concerning 
          Churches, he laid before the Assembly, but could not 
          observe much sense of religion among them, or that 
          any notice was taken. The country has no orthodox 
          Minister legally settled, those formerly here generally 
          gave offence by their vicious lives. Each Parish has 
          churchwardens and a vestry empowered to raise money 
          by a poll-tax, which is applied to maintaining the poor 
          or paying a minister to come out from Virginia, or 
          readers etc. Several parishes by contributions have 
          built chapels etc. LXXVth Instruction. There are 
          already good and wholesome laws for punishing vice, 
          but better framed than executed. Will recommend 
          establishment of schools, so much wanted, when the 
          Assembly is disposed to do business. As for laws for 
          the conversion of Negroes and Indians, does not expect 
          much will be done, when so little regard is had to 
          promote publick worship. LXXVIth Instruction. 
          The Indians of late years are much diminished. There 
          are six nations amongst them, who all live within the 
          English settlements having land assigned them and 
          choosing places most secure from attacks of foreign 
          Indians. These are the Hatteras, Maremuskeets, 
          Potaskites, Chowans, Meherrins and Tuscarora. None 
          exceeds 20 families, except the Tuscaroras who now 
          consist of 200 fighting men etc. There was lately 
          complaints from the Government of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="direct">S. Carolina</placeName> of 
          injuries done the white people by the latter, but they 
          denying the facts are threatened by that Government 
          with a war from the Cherokees and Cataubas. The 
          King of the Tuscaroras is now with him to make some 
          proposals, that the white people of S. Carolina may 
          not come against him, because he says it may bring 
          on a war with the English in general. He has only 
          one Councillor to consult with, the rest being out of 
          the Province or at a very great distance ; will be 
          obliged to fill up some of the vacancies. LXXVIIIth 
          Instruction. There is a law for registering births and 
          burials in each parish, but very little notice taken of 
          it. There are no forts, garrisons, magazines or public 
          arms or ammunition, CIII. Is procuring a map to 
          be done very accurately. CIV. As to boundaries, 
          a river boundary would be much more certain and less 
          expensive than a land line etc. The <placeName ref="#rv_santee" role="boundary">Santee river</placeName> was 
          the ancient boundary etc. CV. The duties are 
          charged on imports or exports, except a powder duty, 
          at first intended for pilotage and buoying out the 
          inlets. Some attempts were made, but of late shamefully
          neglected. The money is chiefly used for paying 
          the Assembly men, who have received 10s. a day 
          travelling expences. There is no law for their being 
          paid, so he refused to sign a warrant at their late 
          prorogation. Hopes for the future they will bear          
          their own charges in North as they do in South Carolina. 
          There are no duties on anything, and only a poll tax 
          of 5s. each tythable bill money (and that by the 
          pretended act in 1729 abolished) and a parish tax to 
          be assessed by the Vestry not exceeding 5s. per poll, 
          so that the whole tax cannot amount to above 10/s. 
          a poll for rateable persons in bill money not exceeding 
          1s. 6d. sterling, and though the people are thus free 
          from taxes or impositions beyond any people in all 
          H.M. Dominions, they seem uneasy that the King's 
          rents should be demanded in Proclamation money or 
          anything else but bills, CVI, CVII. The African 
          Company's trade here has hitherto been small. All 
          encouragement will be given to it. Will endeavour to 
          restore the country to order : it is capable of being 
          made a flourishing colony, and yearly will increase by 
          the coming of people from the Northern settlements 
          etc. The good lands lying commodiously are long 
          since patented, the remainder, the greatest part of 
          the country, are far from navigable waters. For the 
          increase of H.M. revenue and good of the Province, 
          hopes to receive an order to grant lands at 2s. (instead 
          of 4s.) per 100 acres. Has signed but one warrant for 
          taking up lands since his arrival. The trade of this 
          Government is now very miserable, except at <placeName ref="#rv_capefear" role="indirect">Cape Fear River</placeName>.
          The merchants on <placeName ref="#rv_james" role="indirect">James River</placeName> in Virginia supply 
          most of the inhabitants on the north side of <placeName ref="#by_albemarle" role="indirect">Albemarle Sound</placeName> 
          and <placeName ref="#rv_roanoke" role="indirect">Roanoke River</placeName> with 
          British commodities at unreasonable rates, being 
          brought in by land or in little canoos in small 
          quantitys ; the people of <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="indirect">New England</placeName> send in sorry 
          sloops which sail from river to river with West India 
          goods and salt and carry away such things as cannot 
          conveniently be transported into Virginia. The only 
          method to put the traffic in a right way and make the 
          trade advantageous to Great Britain is to settle a 
          Custom House on <placeName ref="#is_ocracoke" role="direct">Ocacock Island</placeName>, where there is a 
          good harbour for vessels of 300 tons etc., to be a port

          Minutes of Privy Council.
          Capt. Dent and Mr. Bladen were called in (v. 2nd June). 
          Capt Dent was asked as to the health and condition of the 2 Regimts. 
          [in <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName>], wch. he said was very bad, but he beleived 
          it was greatly oweing to their own irregularity. That ye regimts. 
          were dispersed all over ye island, some att 100 miles distance. 
          As to ye use of ym for destroying the rebellious negroes, he thinks 
          they may be of use to hinder them coming down, etc. but cannot 
          follow them into ye mountains and destroy them there, wch. he 
          thinks was the original design of sending them thither. He 
          thinks the rebellious negroes more insolent and dangerous than 
          formerly. He does not think, in case of any attempt upon ye 
          island, they cd. be of any use to ye enimy except that of being 
          guides. He was asked whether he thought these regimts. 
          necessary for ye defence of ye island in case of an attempt from 
          an enemy. He says ye island is in a very defenceless condition, 
          and can hardly [?] raise 1000 white men, that as the Regt. are 
          dispersed it would be 8 or 10 days before they can be gott 
          together, and yt. must be done by shipping.      
          Mr. Bladen agreed wt. Capt. Dent in opinion as to ye 
          little service the 2 Regiments would be for ye suppressing 
          ye rebellious negroes, or following them into ye mountains. 
          That his opinion was, and that of ye Board of Trade, yt. 2 
          Independant Comps. should be compleated out of ye Regiments, 
          and then one or both of them might be brought home. Upon 
          the variety of opinions relating to ye necessity or use yt. these 
          two Regimts. may be of att Jamaica, their Lordships determined 
          to referr this matter to ye Board of Trade for their opinion 
          thereupon. The Duke of Newcastle's letter (" my letter ") 
          to Lord Waldegrave of the 1st was read ; and it was proposed 
          that my Lord Lieutenant of <placeName ref="#ie" role="descriptive">Ireland</placeName> should send directions for 
          the regiments to be in a readiness, in case there should be 
          occasion for them ; and also to write to Mr, Keene to acquaint
          him with what has been done here ; and that it shall make no 
          alteration as to the sending the fleet, which shall be there at 
          the time proposed. (Original draft of transactions of the Privy 
          Council). 3 pp. [C.O. 5, 36. ff. 12-13.]</p>

          Acknowledge letters etc. of 5th and 10th Dec. 1730, 13th and 
          25th Jan., 1st March, 5th and 26th April 1731, etc. Continue : If 
          you have not heard from us, in return thereto, it has been 
          because till yor. last letters we did entertain some hopes, that the 
          Assembly might have been prevailed on, to comply with H.M. 
          Instructions relating to your salary. But since you now tell 
          us, in your two last letters, that you have no prospect of that 
          kind, since you have neither come <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">home</placeName> yourself, nor deputed 
          any person according to your Instruction, to lay an acct. of this 
          matter before H.M., we shall take an oppertunity of doing it 
          ourselves, and as soon as we shall know H.M. pleasure thereon, 
          you may expect to hear again from us ; In ye mean time we 
          must acquaint you ; that we have reported our opinion upon 
          ye bill consented to by the Council and Assembly for settling 
          yor. salary, which we can by no means think a compliance, 
          either with the letter or intent of H.M. Instruction. In answer 
          to that part of your last letter, wherein you mention the petition, 
          or memorial from the House of Representatives to H.M. against 
          three of his Royal Instructions to you ; we must observe that 
          the people have an undoubted right of addressing the Crown 
          directly without any prior application to ye Governor, if they 
          think fit to take that method, tho', the more decent way would 
          be to desire their Governor to transmit their Address. We 
          observe what you have wrote in your justification, against what 
          you suppose must have been insinuated against you by Colo. 
          Dunbar ; but we are of opinion, that he had sufficient grounds 
          for his apprehensions, and he would have been wanting in his 
          duty, if he had not sent us such informations as he had receiv'd 
          upon that subject. We thought it would be for H.M. service, 
          that this gentleman should be appointed his Lt. Governor of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, to encrease his authority as Surveyor of ye 
          Woods, and upon our recommendation, H.M. has been pleased 
          to appoint him accordingly. But we presume he will always 
          pay you that regard that is due to his superior officer, and we 
          doubt not but you will treat him as a gentleman that bears 
          H.M. Commission as Lt. Governor. We have considered the 
          New Hampshire bill for emitting 6000£. in bills of credit etc., but 
          we can by no means advise H.M. to allow you to pass any such 
          bill, as it must in consequence lower the credit of the Province, 
          whereby their trade must greatly suffer ; however that we may 
          be the better able to judge of ye state of ye Province with respect 
          to their paper currency, we desire you will send us an acct. of 
          ye paper money now current there ; and what fund there is for 
          sinking the same ? How it has been apply'd and what discount 
          their bills are now lyable to ? We observe what you write 
          concerning ye Council of New Hampshire, but it will be time 
          enough to consider of ye persons you propose, when we shall be 
          informed whose vacancies you propose they should supply. In 
          your letter of 25th Jan. you mention seven gentlemen of whom 
          you say the Council consists ; but you do not inform us, whether 
          ye others who were named in yor. Instructions are dead, or 
          whether they decline acting. We therefore desire you will 
          send us a more perfect acct. etc. [C.O. 5, 916. pp. 419-421.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. An act was lately pass'd
          in your Majesty's Colony of <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> for 
          continuing part of an act for laying a duty on liquors with some 
          alterations and amendments. This act continues the duty of 
          3d. per gall, on wine, rum, brandy and other distilled spirits 
          imported into that Colony, laid by a former law for 5 years 
          ending the 10th of the last month, for three years longer. But 
          there is an additional clause, which provides that only one half 
          of the said duty of 3d. per gallion shall for the future be levied 
          upon any liquors imported by ships wholly and solely belonging 
          to the inhabitants of Virigina. Against this clause we have 
          received objections from several merchts. engaged in the trade 
          of Virginia, and as it appears to be a very partial stipulation 
          in favour of the inhabitants of that Colony, manifestly design'd 
          to encourage their Trade and Navigation in opposition and to 
          the detriment of ye shipping and commerce of <placeName ref="#gb" role="direct">Great Britain</placeName>, 
          we therefore humbly beg leave to lay the same before your 
          Majesty for your disapprobation. [C.O. 5, 1366. pp. 75, 76.]</p>

          any sale is made thereof, or any certainty that negroes 
          will be sold but at such prices as the planter shall

          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts Bay</placeName> to the King. 
          We your Majesty's most loyall and dutifull subjects, having full confidence 
          in your Majesty's paternal care and tenderness, 
          humbly beg leave to lay open to your wise and 
          compassionate consideration the difficultys and distresses 
          your Majesty's subjects in this Province labour under 
          by reason of certain Instructions given your Majesty's 
          Governor, more particularly your Majty. sixteenth 
          Instruction directing the Governor to consent to the 
          emission of 30,000£. only in bills of credit to be called 
          in so suddenly that no more than that sum should 
          pass at one and the same time, which Instruction if 
          complyed with would render it next to impossible 
          to support the Government here, inasmuch as every 
          year for about eleven years to come is loaded with 
          great and heavy debts to be paid for the discharge of 
          such sums as have been expended in the late charge- 
          able and distressing Indian warr in defence of your 
          Majesty's territorys and dutiful subjects here, and 
          could not possibly be defrayed in the respective years 
          wherein such debts were contracted, and while the 
          Province is struggling to discharge the former debts 
          should they be prohibited the emission of any bills to 
          pay the standing charge of the Province, and the 
          laying the funds for drawing them in on any of those 
          years that are as yet burthened with no debt they 
          must necessarily pay about 50,000£. pr. ann., a thing 
          impracticable, especially after a few years when the 
          bills of credit will be mainly called in, which are the 
          only currency whereby publick or private debts can 
          be discharged. Whereas if the Government was 
          permitted to emitt bills of credit to be laid on some 
          future unincumbred years, to pay such part of the 
          annuall charge of the Province as the Government 
          are not at present able to defray besides the old debts, 
          they would in about eleven years intirely discharge 
          the old debts and have only some smaller sums to pay 
          for some part of the standing charge of the Province 
          during the eleven years aforesaid, which in some few 
          years further by the blessing of God on the industry 
          of your subjects here might be discharged and this 
          Province become free from debt. And your Majesty's 
          loyall and dutiful subjects are the more apprehensive 
          of difficulty by this Instruction, because H.E. the 
          Govr. in obedience to your Majesty's commands, 
          and for the good and safety of the Province has directed 
          a survey of your Majesty's forts and garrisons, here, 
          which are very much run to dispare [sic], the necessary 
          reparations whereof, it is supposed may cost 20 or 
          30,000£. This House are also under great concern that 
          they are not able in faithfulness to the rights and 
          privileges of your people here to comply with your 
          Majesty's 27th Instruction directing the settlement 
          of a salary on the Governor for the time being by 
          reason (as we humbly conceive) that the frame and 
          constitution of our Government would thereby be 
          very much altered if not subverted and our circumstances 
          be farr different from those of English subjects ; 
          there would be no ballance of power in the severall 
          branches of the Legislature, the House of Representatives 
          would depend on the Governor for many 
          things of the greatest consequence to them and the 
          interest and safety of the people they represent, 
          while no obligation in those points will lie on the 
          Governor. This notwithstanding your Majesty's loyal 
          subjects are willing and desirous to grant from time 
          to time an ample and honourable support to your 
          Majesty's Governors suitable to the dignity of their 
          station, and accordingly soon after his Excellency's 
          arrival a grant of 3000£. past the House of Representatives, 
          but was non-concurr'd by your Majesty's 
          Council, after which an act past making a further 
          offer for H.E.'s ample and honourable support, and 
          being concurred by the Council was laid before H.E. 
          for his consent, the which he refused by reason of 
          your Majesty's Instruction, and at the opening the 
          present session the aforesaid Instruction being again 
          recommended by the Governor, has rendered the 
          severall attempts of this Court for H.E.'s support 
          without the settlement of a sallary ineffectuall. Your 
          Majesty's good subjects of this Province are also 
          under great difficultys on account of your Majesty's 
          30th Instruction, whereby as it is understood and 
          proposed to be practised on, the Treasury of this 
          Province is taken from the care of the House of Representatives 
          and all the money therein subjected to the 
          will and pleasure of the Governor and Councill, without 
          possibility of redress how unjustly soever the money 
          in the Treasury may be misapplyed, this the House of 
          Representatives cannot but humbly apprehend to 
          be against common right and equity ; that those who 
          grant and whose constituents pay all the publick 
          money should neither see the accounts whereby the 
          Province becomes indebted to prevent misapplications 
          or unjust paymts. of the money nor when it is mis- 
          applied or wasted be in any way of obtaining relict ; for 
          the direction in the Instruction as to a future inquiry 
          may serve to give us a more full sence and clearer view 
          of the loss and wast of the publick money, and thereby 
          increase our sorrow and distress, but neither affords 
          nor points at any sort of remedy, the House of Representatives 
          cannot impeach such as shall misapply the 
          money in the Treasury, according to the ancient and 
          well-known practice of the Honoble. House of Commons 
          before the Right Honoble. the Lords Spiritual and 
          Temporal etc. But the only methods that seem by 
          this Instruction to be left the House of Representatives, 
          are either to supply the Treasury with money as long 
          as the people they represent have any, let their money 
          be never so much imbezzelled, or otherwise to refuse 
          all supply and leave the Treasury empty which would 
          be in effect to dismantle all the forts and garrisons 
          leave the Government defenceless, and put an end to 
          all safety. As to which severall Instructions your 
          Majesty's most dutyful subjects humbly implore your 
          Majesty's favour and compassion that the Government 
          here may be permitted to go on in a way that is 
          practicable, in paying what they are in arrears, and 
          to support your Majesty's Governor suitable to the 
          dignity of your Majesty's commission, and in order 
          thereunto, most humbly beg that your Majesty would 
          be graciously pleased to grant your royall order of 
          leave to your present Governor to accept of what has 
          been or may be offered him from time to time, for his 
          ample and honourable support when he shall deem 
          it to be so, and that there may be the usuall securitys 
          allowed as to the money in the Treasury. Signed, In

          Governor Belcher to the same. Since his letter of 12th 
          June, has heard from Col. Dunbar that he has received H.M. 
          Commission to be Lt. Governor of N.H., and quickly intended 
          thither. Continues : Whereupon I gave orders to the 
          President of H.M. Council there, that upon his arrival he should 
          summon the Council, and have his Commission publisht with 
          the usuall solemnity, and with all possible respect to H.M., 
          which was accordingly done, and Collo. Dunbar thank'd me 
          therefor. Soon after which the Assembly sat att the time to 
          which I had prorogu'd it, on the special business of the disputed 
          boundaries betwixt <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts</placeName> 
          and <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">Newhamshire</placeName>, and 
          my orders to the President of the Councill (before Collo. Dunbar's 
          arrival) were to go upon no other affair att that time, and in case 
          any vote was agreed to by the Councill and Representatives, to 
          send it hither to me, to approve and sign. Upon this, my Lord 
          Duke, the Lt. Governor wrote me word he had litterally executed 
          my orders, and wou'd untill he had the words of his Commission 
          viz. in case of the Capn. Generalls death or absence explained to 
          him from home. To which etc. I wrote him, that the King in 
          his royall instruction does not call my being in the Massachusetts 
          an absence from Newhamshire, and that former Lt. Governours 
          of New Hampshire had acted by the order of the Governour-in- 
          Chief, altho' he was in the Massachusetts, and this my Lord 
          Duke is certainly fact, and I think to be supported with the 
          greatest justice and reason. If while the Captn. Generall and 
          Governour-in-Chief is but 60 miles from New Hampshire, his 
          Lieutenant shall presume to interfere with or dispute his orders, 
          it must certainly lead to great confusion in the King's Govern- 
          ment by weakning the authority of his Governour and thereby 
          lessning the King's honour. I therefore hope with great 
          deference to your Grace that no applications of my Lt. Governour 
          will prevail to debarr me of any part of the power and honour 
          which H.M. has in his great grace and favour conferr'd upon 
          me, and which my predecessors have enjoy'd. I have not, my 
          Lord Duke, been arriv'd from <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">great Brittain</placeName> quite eleven 
          months, and I have made three journeys to H.M. province of 
          New Hamshire and am going thither again in a few weeks, by 
          which your Grace will see I do everything in my power for H.M. 
          honour and service there. Nor have I receiv'd from that 
          Government half so much as was the charge of my Commission, 
          and in the Massachusetts your Grace is sensible I have not 
          receiv'd one farthing, tho' I have been and am att a great 
          expence etc. Repeats the request that Col. Dunbar may not be 
          countenanced in his attempts to subvert his authority etc.

          Lt. Governor Gooch to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Refers to enclosed public papers and former letter 
          relating to the dispute with the Agent of Lord Fairfax concerning the bounds of 
          <placeName ref="#us_va_northernneck" role="direct">the Northern Neck</placeName> etc.  (v. C.S.P. June 29, 1729). 
          Continues : Since which the people in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">this Dominion</placeName> as well 
          as many strangers from <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="direct">Pensilvania</placeName> have discovered a strong 
          inclination to extend our settlements on the western side of the 
          <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="direct">great mountains</placeName>, and on the 
          <placeName ref="#rv_goosecreek" role="direct">River Cohongaroonton</placeName>, under 
          grants from this Government to hold their lands of the Crown, 
          to which they urge too that land doth of right belong, as lying 
          beyound any part of those rivers called <placeName ref="#rv_rappahannock" role="direct">Rappahannock</placeName> or 
          <placeName ref="#rv_potomac" role="direct">Potomack</placeName> etc. : On the other hand the Proprietor's Agent 
          insists that not only the main stream, which forms those rivers, 
          but all other rivers and streams which communicate therewith, 
          by what names soever they are known, and the lands 
          encompassed thereby are within the limits of his grant. 
          Notwithstanding which, I have hitherto according to the advice of the 
          Council allowed such as have applied for grants of those lands to 
          seat thereon with promise of patents so soon as they bring the 
          number of people they propose to settle that frontier ; judging 
          that the Proprietor's charter can't have so large a construction 
          as is pretended, and being sensible how much it is for H.M. 
          interest to encourage such settlements, since by that means 
          we may in a few years get possession of <placeName ref="#lk_great" role="indirect">the Lakes</placeName>, and be in a 
          condition to prevent the French surrounding us by their 
          settlements. Until this matter is adjusted with Ld. Fairfax, I shal, 
          as much as in me lieth, prevent every uneasiness that might 
          interrupt our present purpose, hoping if it is not likely to meet 
          with a speedy determination, that your Lordships will advise 
          me in what manner I shal proceed in the disposal of those lands 
          and in the protection of the people who take grants under the 
          Crown, from the encroachment of the Proprietor's Agent. It 
          is some time since I informed your Lordships how necessary 
          it is to secure the mouth of <placeName ref="#rv_james" role="direct">James River</placeName> by a fort or at least a 
          substantial battery ; and at the same time I wrote to the Board 
          of Ordinance for some cannon and other stores, to which letter 
          I sent a duplicate, but have received no answer ; and now that 
          I am putting in order the other batterys, which are become 
          ruinous, I should be glad not only to receive your Lordships' 
          sentiments thereon, but to be supplied also with ordnance and 
          stores suitable to such a work, and doubt not your Lordships' 
          representation to that Board will procure what is necessary, 
          about a dozen of six and thirty pounders and four eighteen 
          pounders with strong carriages etc., and a sufficient quantity 
          of shot, and then I shal send home the old guns upon that 
          ruined battery, which are no longer fit for service, with above 
          thirty pieces of cannon which I took out of Rappahannock 
          River where they had been about three-score years etc. Our 
          stores of powder are become very small, for 'tis now a great 
          many years since any was sent in, and some of that which 
          remains is decayed and unfit for service. I hope by your 
          Lordships' favour to receive a speedy supply, being very desirous 
          to provide against the insults of pirates, which we have reason 
          to expect from the usual encrease of that kind of vermin in times 
          of peace, and to secure us against the insurrection of our slaves, 
          the enemy I do assure your Lordships we have great reason to 
          be apprehensive of. Your Lordships will observe from the 
          Council Journal what preparations are made towards putting 
          in execution the Act for amending the staple of tobacco etc., 
          it is now two moneths since Commissioners were appointed to 
          direct the building of the warehouses, and almost as long since 
          we made choice of Inspectors, in which all immaginable care 
          has been taken with regard to the skill and integrity of the 
          persons and the ability of their securitys. It was absolutely 
          necessary to enter so early on the building the warehouses, 
          because of the length of time requisite for finishing so great a 
          work, and the advantage of the summer for erecting the wharfs, 
          which could not be so well carried out in an uncertain season ; 
          however I deferr'd this until point of time would admit of no 
          delay and then boldly entered upon it through various dis- 
          couraging reports, being satisfied that no substantial objection 
          could be made against the law. But notwithstanding the 
          assurance I have always entertained that your Lordships would 
          not suffer a law to miscarry which is so well calculated to do 
          justice to the Crown in all its revenue, to establish a fair and 
          honest measure of dealing between man and man, to encourage 
          the adventures of the fair trader, to raise a sinking trade, and 
          when once we are well fixed in it, to give a more easy and quick 
          dispatch to the ships sent hither on freight, it is with great 
          concern that I am obliged to represent to your Lordships, that 
          the suspense under which this law has layn, has afforded an 
          oppertunity to the masters of ships and others to propagate 
          divers storys, sometimes as if a repeal was certainly to be 
          expected, and at other times, and what is now agreed by all, 
          that it is only to continue during one crop and then to be 
          annulled : by this means many people who intended to build 
          vessels for the more speedy lading of their ships have been 
          discouraged, which I doubt not was the principal aim of those 
          reports, and will in some measure have their effect in retarding 
          the dispatch of the ships this next year, who I fear on this very 
          account will not get their lading so soon as otherwise they would 
          have done. But notwithstanding these artifices practiced here 
          by those who are by this law restrained from pilfering 
          and running tobacco, I hope the advantages of it will be 
          found, tho' perhaps not such as I should have expected, had I 
          gone on without opposition, and no handle given to work upon 
          the apprehensions of the people. And lest the same game 
          should be played over again, and the people still kept under the 
          like fears to the obstructing the good effects of this law, I humbly 
          intreat your Lordships to obtain H.M. royal approbation of 
          it for the time it is to continue, which I am perswaded will add 
          so great force to the measures projected thereby, as will clearly 
          demonstrate its usefulness both to the encrease of the Customs, 
          the advancing the value and goodness of the staple of this 
          country, and the great ease and benefit of all traders. I have 
          this one truth to add which will not be denied by any one that 
          goes from hence, that the common planters are so far from being 
          discouraged by the supposed charges and hardships pretended 
          to be imposed on them by this law, that there never was known 
          so great a crop of tobacco on the ground as at present, the 
          planters exerting their utmost industry, which I hope will put 
          to silence the false reasonings of those who suggest imaginary 
          fears of its lessening the importation and consequently the 
          revenue, when 'tis plain from experience that the people of 
          Virginia can never be diverted from making tobacco but only 
          by the lowness of its price. Whilst I was writting what is 
          above, I recd. advice of a petition prepared by the merchants of 
          <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName> and <placeName ref="#en_bristol" role="indirect">Bristol</placeName> 
          trading to <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">America</placeName>, and designed to be 
          presented to the Parliament for an act to be passed, prohibiting 
          and makeing void all laws passed in the Plantations laying 
          dutys which may affect the trade or shipping of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>; 
          that lands in America may be lyable to the payments of debts ; 
          and appeals allowed for any sum exceeding 100£. When I 
          considered, my Lords, how long and happily the British subjects 
          have traded to <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="secondary">America</placeName> and acquired great riches under the 
          ancient establishment made in these parts by the Crown, 
          sett forth in the Royal Charters and Instructions, without 
          seeking to abridge the people of the Plantations of their birth- 
          right as Englishmen, or limiting the Crown in the methods of 
          Government, I must confess I was somewhat startled, for 
          which reason I cannot forbear laying before your Lordships 
          my thoughts on this extraordinary attempt of the merchants, 
          tho' what I shal offer will be undigested, having had little 
          leisure to discourse of it. As to laws affecting trade etc., 'tis 
          no easy matter to guess how far they design this shall extend. 
          Neither of the duties by which the Government is supported, 
          and thereby British trade and shipping encouraged and 
          protected, can be set aside without weakening it, etc. 
          Continues : There seems to be a farther view in this scheme, 
          for if no dutys or fees are to be established here to affect their 
          trade, then there can be no regulation of the tobacco trade, 
          no penaltys on lading bulk tobacco, and pillaging or changing 
          the freighters' hogsheads, and our late act for amending the 
          staple of tobacco must fall in course : and indeed I suspect 
          the petition is by a side wind levelled at that act, for the act 
          carrys too clear a countenance of justice and honesty to be 
          attacked openly by itself. But above this, such a petition is, 
          with submission, a great disrespect to the King whose 
          instructions and orders to His Governors are no more to be 
          relied on, though always fully complied with as far as the 
          nature of the subject matter would admit. Besides H.M. has 
          it always in his power to make void any act inconsistent with the 
          interest of the British subject etc. Continues : The proposal of 
          making of lands lyable to the payment of debts is not treating 
          the people in the Plantations as if they were English subjects : 
          lands here are held by the same tenure as in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, and are 
          now lyable to the payment of debts in the same manner as lands 
          in England are, and the British merchant may as easily come 
          at them after judgment obtained in the Courts of America, 
          as any man here can do, or as if the lands lay in England on 
          suits brought there. Common justice requires that legal 
          remedys should be reciprocal, and whenever a law shall pass 
          in England making real estates subject to debts in any other 
          manner than now they are, the Plantations will no doubt be 
          very easie under such a petition. But whilst the people here 
          have no method to recover their demands out of the lands of 
          the merchant, and are too remote to be admitted to the benefit 
          of the Commission of Bankruptcy sued out against insolvent 
          merchants, it would be hard to lay so unequal a burden on 
          them alone, which in a few years must prove the ruin of the 
          Plantation, or else sett them upon supplying themselves wth. 
          manufactures of their own without being beholden to their 
          Mother-country under such hard terms ; but it seems the 
          petitioners only look to present interest without regarding 
          what the consequence may be in future generations. The last 
          thing proposed as to appeals for 100£. value or upwards is no 
          less unreasonable, as it would be attended with the most 
          fatal consequences to the Plantation, as will appear from what 
          frequently happens etc. ; A planter consigns 10 hhds. of tobacco 
          to his merchant in London, desiring him to sell them and out 
          of the produce to send him such and such goods. The 
          merchant sends the goods, and with them an account of sales 
          of the tobacco ; the next year more tobacco is consigned and 
          more goods are sent for, and then comes an account current 
          wherein the planter has credit for his first tobacco consigned, 
          and so the correspondence continues for three or four years ; 
          at last the merchant sends the planter a letter telling him that 
          the tobacconist to whom he sold four or five hogsheads of his 
          first consigned tobacco is broke, that the money is lost, and 
          the planter must repay it ; and for that money and some other 
          small debt making in all 100£. he is sued. In this case, though 
          no Court or Jury can possibly charge the planter with this loss 
          after three years time, when it is proved that the merchant 
          never sells without ready money, or on six months credit at 
          most, and therefore the merchant must have given farther 
          credit on his own accot. and risque, and thereupon there is a 
          verdict here for the planter : yet if the bill now petitioned for 
          passes, there is an appeal, and the poor planter knowing no 
          man in England to whom he can entrust the defences there, 
          and considering the charge he must be at of at least 70£., or 80 
          on the tryal in England, will find it more for his interest to 
          pay what is unjustly charged him than to defend himself at 
          such an expence. Many more instances may be given as I 
          am told of the like hardships in the matter of accots. which the 
          planters here must submit to, if appeals be allowed for so small 
          a sum etc., for a voyage from America to England and four or 
          five moneths attendance there for the hearing of an appeal is 
          no trifling expence. So that I humbly conceive the sum already 
          limited by H.M. Instructions is much more reasonable etc. 
          Continues : If what the petitioners propose, tended any way 
          to the interest of the British trade, to the securing the 
          dependency of the Plantations to the Crown, or to the con- 
          sumption of the British manufactures, I should be far from 
          objecting against them ; But 'tis plain to me they must have 
          a quite contrary effect in all these particulars, seeing they 
          aim at depriving the Plantations of the means of supporting the 
          respective Governments and providing for their necessary 
          defence in time of danger, tend to alienate the affections of the 
          people from their Mother-Country, and to compel them to fall 
          on other means to subsist and cloath their familys than by 
          British manufactures, and in short the whole project is so very 
          unreasonable, that the best thing I can say of the gentlemen 
          concerned in the petition is, that they know not what they ask. 
          I have still one thing more to lay before your Lordships which 
          shal be done by the hands of our Agent, in order to have the 
          opinion of the Attorney and Sollicitor General, whether slaves, 
          Christians or not, convicted in the Plantations of such crimes 
          as by the laws of England are within the benefit of clergy, are 
          entitled to the priviledge of the statutes of England concerning 
          Clergy etc. Signed, William Gooch. Endorsed, Recd. 4th Oct.,

          Col. Dunbar to Mr. Popple. Was at <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Fredericks Fort</placeName>
          when he received his Commission for Lt. Govr. etc. Is wholly 
          indebted to the Council of Trade for that favour and will do 
          his best to deserve their good opinion etc. Continues : I waited 
          some time at Fredericks Fort to receive an officer and a partie 
          of soldiers from Collo. Philips regiment from <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName> etc. 
          I sent for them according to my Instructions upon rumours 
          that the Indians were prejudiced against us, in September last, 
          but they did not arrive until the 14th of June, the 23rd of the 
          same month I sailed thence, and landed here next day ; I was 
          very kindly reced. by the Gentn., but my Commission was not 
          published until the 28th that they might have time to shew 
          some honours which Govr. Belcher was pleased to order upon 
          that occasion, and which I would willingly have declined ; 
          upon the first inst. the Assembly sat, and by a written order 
          from <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName> from the Chief Governour were only to renew a 
          former vote impowering a Committee to meet another from 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts Bay</placeName> at 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_newburyport" role="direct">Newbury</placeName> about setling the lines, and 
          then immediately to prorogue them to September. I was 
          surprized a few moments before I had the honour to meet the 
          Assembly to be told that a speech was expected from me, and 
          it put me under concern as I have no talent that way, herewith 
          I send you a copy of it and the answer of the House of Repre- 
          sentatives, but intreat it may not be made a Coffee House 
          diversion by exposing it in print (more majorum). I was not 
          less surprized to be informed from the sd. order from the 
          Governour, that any vote passed here must be sent to him to 
          Boston to be signed, and when I asked the opinion of the Council 
          thereupon and whether or no the chief Governour was then 
          present or absent, I was answered that he was deemed to be 
          virtually present, and I had nothing to do but obey his orders. 
          A majority of the Council (there were but six present) were of 
          that opinion they are under some obligations to him but the 
          other Gentn. quoted instances where Lieut. Govrs. have held 
          General Assemblies, passed acts and done every other act of 
          Governmt. in his own name when the Chief Govr. was at Boston, 
          however I was inclined to avoid disputes with him as may be 
          seen by a copy of a letter I wrote to him on the 3rd instant, 
          with his answer to it, so that I am of so little significancy that 
          I am really ashamed ; however if my Lords Commissioners are 
          of opinion against me I shall chearfully submit, tho' Mr. Belcher 
          is the very last man upon the globe that I would choose to be 
          a sub to, it is incredible how he has maltreated me, he has not 
          only murthered my character in this country, by saying I was 
          a poor lying insignificant fellow, but influenced as great acts of 
          injustice against me as ever was imposed upon any man etc. 
          Complains that he has intercepted his letters and handed about 
          one from his wife etc. (v. July 15th). Continues : I am really 
          apt to beleive it is a counterfeit letter, because I cannot conceive 
          what my wife could write to me to give my enemies so much 
          pleasure ; I lately had an accot. of this attempt of Mr. Belcher's 
          to print the letter from a gentn. of fortune and veracity, which 
          provoked me to write a letter to him. Encloses copy to the 
          Board. Continues : If it be thought I was too warm, I hope 
          the provocation will justifie me ; after this I fear my accot. of 
          the present state of this province etc. may be tho't somewhat 
          prejudiced against Governour Belcher ; it is most certain that 
          no colony can be in greater confusion, he has turned out so 
          many gentn. from the country imployments without consulting 
          the Council or shewing that he had a power in himself by his 
          Instructions etc., that there is a stagnation of Justice, no 
          Superior Court having sat since he displaced the old Judges, 
          of which, now not one amongst the four of that Court ; the 
          Speaker Collo. Wiggins was one, and upon the Governour's 
          putting a man before him in a new Commission, who had ever 
          been his inferiour, he declined acting for which he was by an 
          unpresidented written order striped of all imployments in open 
          Court, having been Collo. of one of the regiments and for many 
          years in Commission of the Peace, he is a man of a very good 
          character and much esteemed etc. The Governour has not yet 
          appointed any Justices of the Peace in the town where Collo. 
          Wiggins lives, nor in four other townships where he hath turned 
          out gentn. who have long served in that Commission, the country 
          imployments are worth nothing and none but gentn. of fortune 
          can support ym., a Judge of the Superiour Court I am told is not 
          worth more than thirteen pounds pr. annum, which is about 
          2d. per diem sterl. He has removed the Courts from this which 
          is the Province town to 3 country towns so that but one of four 
          yearly Courts sit here, he is said to be influenced to do all this 
          by one Mr. Waldron, an Attorney, who has been for some time 
          Clerk of the Council, he is now a Member of it, by the Govr's. 
          appointment, tho' there was no vacancy that he had power to 
          fill, untill they prevailed upon Mr. Westbrook his father-in-law 
          to resign, he is also made a Judge, and a Justice of the Peace, 
          and is commissioned Province Secretary which is new here, he is 
          very obnoxious to many of the better sort of people and to him 
          are imputed all the inconveniencies now upon the Province. 
          I have had frequent complaints from the country which you'l 
          find I represented to H.E., and you'l see by his answer to how 
          little purpose. I fear that I am remiss in my duty in not 
          remedying them myself, and beleive I shall, if he does not soon 
          appoint magistrates ; no two were ever more like to like then 
          Mr. Belcher and his chief Minister which he has the assurance to 
          call Sr. Robert, this is fact and cannot be denyed he has another 
          at Boston which he himself calls so, one Pemberton whom he 
          sends on errants, anybody who has been at Boston can vouch 
          this, Mr. Dalton a gentn. now in <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="secondary">Londo</placeName>. of extraordinary good 
          character and Mr. Barker a relation to Sr. Thomas Frankland 
          can vouch it ; the sudden prorogation of the Assembly here 
          made the country a little dissatisfied with me, until the 
          Governour's orders were made publick for so doing ; this 
          prevented them from addressing H.M. and therefore some of 
          the Council and Assembly the three members for <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">this town</placeName> 
          and some other of the chief inhabitants have joyned in a 
          memorial to my Lords Commissioners which they have requested 
          me to transmit, and to pray a speedy answer. I herewith send 
          it and humbly recommend it to their Lordships it could not be 
          imagined that from my last arrival here as Lieut. Governour 
          I could know so much as I do of the state of the country. I 
          have formerly spent part of my time here as Surveyor, and in 
          my letters home I always did them the justice to say how civil 
          and respectful they were to the King's Officers, and a very 
          different people from their neighbours of the Massachusetts, 
          who too frequently shew their disregard to H.M. servants ; I 
          mention this only because it has been represented here that I 
          had given an ill character of them at home, which would have 
          been false and unjust ; I heartily wish they were under a 
          seperate Govermt. from the Massachusetts for the reasons in 
          their memorial and I hope it will not be imagined I am induced 
          to be of this opinion in hopes of being the man myself, the 
          Province is small and unable at present to give a seperate 
          Governour anything more then they have now setled upon 
          their chief Governour, and therefore it would be worth nobody's 
          acceptance but one of themselves, the late Lieut. Governour 
          was born here and there are many worthy gentn. and good 
          subjects, Mr. George Jaffry is the second in the Council, Collo. 
          Walton the first being ancient, is passed being fit, and when 
          my Lords are pleased to remove me, I take leave to recommend 
          Mr. Jaffry as the properest person to serve H.M. I ought to 
          do the gentn. the justice, to own that there are others well 
          deserving but if they had the nomination themselves, Mr. 
          Jaffry would be the man etc. Refers to enclosures. Upon 
          reading them I beg my Lords will observe the difference in the 
          wording of the two acts from this Province and the Massachusetts, 
          for adjusting the lines between ym., and whether one 
          do's not shew a better disposition towards it than the other ; 
          it is not to be expected it can be setled on <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">this side the water</placeName>, 
          an order from H.M. with an explanation of the words relating 
          to it, and the line of longitude, in the last Charter must 
          determine it, and they hope they will not be circumscribed by 
          the northerly course of the turn of <placeName ref="#rv_merrimack" role="boundary">Merrimack River</placeName> but that 
          their westerly bounds will extend as farr as their neighbours 
          on either side ; If the charter of the Massachusetts is to be 
          vacated then Merrimack River will be the natural bounds 
          between the two as far as the course is near westerly, and 
          whenever that happens the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">Province of Main</placeName> added to 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> would be a handsome and extensive Governmt. 
          and would be convenient and pleasing to both people ; there 
          is another wide difference between New Hampshire and their 
          neighbours, there they are Independants, and great zealots, 
          here they are moderate and inclining to the Church of <placeName ref="#en" role="descriptive">England</placeName>, 
          tho' there never was one within the Province ; the Gentn. of 
          this town, and who are generally in disgrace with H.E., have 
          made handsome subscriptions for building a church, and are 
          upon beginning it, but the maintenance of a Minister at first 
          will be very heavy upon ym. as the congregation will not be 
          very numerous, they are upon sending a modest and ingenious 
          gentleman to be ordained by my Lord Bishop of London, who 
          has been some years a preacher in this country, he was bred 
          at <placeName ref="#us_ma_cambridge" role="indirect">Cambridge</placeName> Colledge near Boston and is very desirous of being 
          in orders, but discouraged from the thoughts of returning to 
          this country because the maintenance of Ministers is generally 
          very small, and no chance for a man of any merit to preferment. 
          I'll take the liberty to recommend him to my Lord's interest 
          to get some encouragemt. from H.M. as well from the Society 
          for propagating the Gospel, and I hope such would have a very 
          good effect in these parts. Govr. Belcher bro't over some 
          Church plate and ornamts. for one of the churches at Boston, 
          as H.M. bounty, I humbly pray my Lords will recommend this 
          new one for the like favour. Enumerates six present Councillors. 
          Continues : There is but one more vizt. Capt. Frost, but he is 
          uncapable having lost his speech and his limbs by the palsy etc. 
          Mr. Waldron is hitherto only recommended to H.M. for a 
          mandamus, but I earnestly intreat the favour that he may not 
          be of the number for the aforesd. reasons, and for the oppositions 
          he formerly gave me in conjunction with his father-in-law Mr. 
          Westbrook when I made a formal tender of 130 mast trees 
          which were seized here by my Deputies, this may appear by 
          a copy of a most scurilous letter wrote by Mr. Waldron, and 
          signed by Mr. Westbrook to the late Lieut. Governour here, 
          wherein he and I were much abused, which copy I transmitted 
          to you 18 months ago, and which I request you will once more 
          lay before the Board. As Lieut. Governour I am told I have 
          no place nor vote at the Council table when the Chief Governour 
          is there. I therefore pray that I may have an order or qualification
          to regulate as my Lords intend it should be, and I should

          Mr. Theodore Atkinson, Mr. Joshua Peirce senr., Collo. Andrew 
          Wiggin, and Collo. John Gilman to be of the Council ; my brother 
          will take out their mandamus's, these would only make up ten 
          of the number, and it would be a credit to me to be intrusted 
          with a blank mandamus or two to fill upon occasion ; the 
          gentn. that is about going to be ordained his name is William 
          Shurtaff, if my Lords would be pleased to recommend him to 
          be Province Secretary by H.M. Commission he is well qualified 
          and would be a help to him and his small congregation, it is 
          not worth above 25£. sterl. pr. annum. It is now time for me 
          to make an apology for this tedious epistle which with my 
          most humble duty I pray you will lay before my Lords and 
          favour me with an answer etc. Signed, D. Dunbar. Endorsed,

        <p>290. ii. Memorial of members of Council and of Assembly 
          and of other inhabitants of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> to the 
          Council of Trade and Plantations 10th July, 1731. 
          We etc. inhabitants of H.M. loyal and dutifull tho' 
          small and poore Province of New Hampshire in America 
          being lately dissapointed of an opertunity of addressing 
          our most gracious King from the Representatives of 
          our people in General Court assembled and setting 
          forth the hardships we suffer by the dispute about 
          the lines between us and the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, 
          this dissapointment being occasioned by a sudden 
          prorogation after one day's sitting by our Lieut. 
          Governour pursuant to directions sent from our Chief 
          Governour from <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="indirect">Boston</placeName>, which was very surprising 
          to the House of Representatives here who at the 
          instant of prorogation were prepairing such address, 
          doe therefore most humbly pray to be permitted to 
          lay our said hardships before your Lordships. When 
          our present Chief Governour was pleased to communicate
          to us the Royal Instruction for settling the 
          said lines we received them with all thankfulness and 
          duty and imediately proceeded upon naming our 
          Commissioners in the very manner prescribed in the 
          Instructions, but our choice not being approved by 
          H.E. and very difficult to find others qualified we 
          readily came into other measures to facilitate the 
          settlement of the said lines, as may appear by attested 
          coppys of the proceedings thereupon. All which 
          proving ineffectual and having too much reason to 
          beleive that our neighbours of the Massachusetts Bay doe 
          not desire to have the lines fixed because wee apprehend 
          that they are making settlements which will be deemed 
          farr on our side the lines and are frequently exercising 
          an authority and jurisdiction nine, tenn and eleven 
          miles to the northward of <placeName ref="#rv_merrimack" role="boundary">Merrymack River</placeName> by seizing 
          and carrying away some of our inhabitants, imprisoning 
          sueing and fineing them at their courts on the south 
          side of the sd. river to the great dammage and dis- 
          couragement of many poor familys. We therefore 
          humbly pray your Lordships favour that H.M. may 
          be addressed to interpose and give his royal orders 
          for ascertaining and determining the lines in dispute 
          to which we shall cheerfully submit as we have always 
          done to his pleasure well knowing that H.M. can have 
          no other intentions than the wellfair, prosperity and 
          ease of his loyal subjects. We further begg leave to 
          represent to your Lordships that this small Province 
          labours under vast disadvantages by being under the 
          Government of the same person with the Massachusetts 
          as that Province is very considerable in respect to us, 
          and the Governor's sallary chiefly arising there. We 
          have been denied and cannot at any time reasonably 
          hope for his assent to some acts which would be 
          beneficial to our small Province, which if we were 
          under a seperate Governour would not be denyed to 
          us and which might also enable us much better to pay 
          the sallary which we have already pursuant to H.M. 
          Instruction settled upon our Chief Governour, so as 
          to enable a Governour of our own to support that 
          rank. If we might presume to begg this favour of 
          his Majesty it would be such an act of his goodness as 
          would forever make His memory deare to our posterity 
          as his royal person is now to us. To mention any other 
          greivance which we feel we fear would render us too 
          troublesome to your Lordships and imploye more of 
          your precious time than our proportion, and they are 
          such as might easily be remedyed here, several of our 
          towns are at this time destitute of any magistrate 
          insomuch that a constable has come to the town of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">Portsmouth</placeName> 38 miles to be sworn into his office, and no 
          Justice of the Peace nearer to the town he came from 
          then 23 miles, this misfortune we labour under by an 
          unhappy displeasure conceived against some of us by 
          our Cheif Governour as we apprehend tho' we humbly 
          are of opinion without the least grounds, we having 
          not only complyed with everything he asked of us in 
          his Majesties, but passed a vote for paying him six 
          months sallary beforehand, whereby in case of death 
          or removal we may be lyable to pay the same or most 
          part thereof to his successor. Pray for an answer to 
          this remonstrance etc. Signed, Geo. Jaffrey, Andrew

          Representation upon Act of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> for the better
          regulating slaves etc., (for reasons set out, A.P.C. III. pp. 344, 345 q.v.)
          The Act in effect repeals former laws passed at Jamaica in favour of 
          several negroes who had been made free for their faithful 
          services, and their descendants, and especially John Williams, 
          his wife, and descendants." It is also impolitick in its tendency 
          with respect to the interest and welfare of Jamaica, as well as 
          unequitable to the persons above mentioned ; and to the whole 
          order of free negroes, since it manifestly tends to discourage the 
          integrity of the slaves in that island, as well as the industry of 
          those who are become free : whereas it would in our humble 
          opinion be very prudent, eminently to reward all extraordinary 
          examples of fidelity and virtue amongst the negroes of all 
          denominations for the better governing of a people whose 
          service is so essential to the prosperity both of this Colony and 
          of all your Majesty's Plantations. We therefore take leave to lay this act 
          before your Majesty for your disapprobation. [C.O. 138, 17. ff. 319-321.]</p>

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Is 
          obliged to trouble his Grace again after his letter of 10th July, 
          because he learns that some complaint is going <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">home</placeName> from
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> against him. Continues : 
          I have good reason to believe my Lt. Governor is att the head of this affair. 
          Your Grace will upon this judge how inconsistent it is with the King's 
          honour and service to have Collo. Dunbar continu'd to interfere 
          and give trouble to the King's Governor etc. Continues : I 
          now take the opportunity to give your Grace ten thousand 
          thanks for the stop you put to his Commission for some time 
          (as my friends inform'd me), and I wish to God it had been 
          finally stopt, for he is the most restless uneasy Gentleman I 
          ever had to do with. I woud still begg of your Grace he may 
          be otherwise provided for, and that Coll. Henry Sherburn might 
          be my Lieutenant Governor etc. Col. Dunbar's ill nature and 
          prejudice against him are such that he supposes the same com- 
          plaints against his are of the same kind as his pompous and 
          fictitious complaint about <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="indirect">Frederick's Fort</placeName>, by which also much 
          trouble was caused owing to his not having been allowed to see 
          its contents before being sent home etc. When he himself 
          exhibited a complaint against Governor Burnett at <placeName ref="#en_lon_whitehall" role="direct">Whitehall</placeName>, 
          the answer was that no proceedings could be made upon it but 
          to serve Governor Burnett with a copy for his answer etc. 
          Concludes : I remember an observation of a great man when 
          I was att Whitehall upon an opposition made in the house of 
          Commons, that the pasture was streight and the cattle numerous. 
          This may it please your Grace (comparing small things with 
          great) is the case att New Hampshire. Men that are out of 
          office, wou'd feign be in, and because they can't, the next thing

          of the interest money paid into the Treasury by virtue of a law to 
          the incidental charges of this Government and for subjecting the 
          residue to future appropriations. Describe provisions of the 
          Act of 1723 referred to. Continue : Under these regulations 
          [the original bills] have obtained a general circulation and have 
          not hitherto been subject to that discredit which hath usually 
          attended a paper currency in other parts of America. But 
          by the present act the original appropriation is destroyed and 
          the surplus of the interest made applicable to other purpose 
          that of sinking the paper debt. Refer to their letter of Nov. 
          20, 1728, recommending Governor Montgomerie to urge the 
          Assembly to repeal the last clause in the Act of 1728, " and 
          to restore this fund to its original appropriation for the more 
          speedy and effectual sinking the said paper currency, which 
          not having been complied with on their part, we now take leave

          Lt. Governor Dunbar to Mr. Popple. Has been

          that county money etc. Continues : It is not above 11,OOO£. 
          sterl., and there is a very great necessity for it, there is no such 
          thing as gold or silver mony <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">here</placeName>, and so little paper money 
          (as it is called) that one of my Deputy Surveyors tells me he 
          cannot gett of that sort, vallue for a bill of 15£. sterl., and I 
          myself have been 10 days enquireing for province bills for a 
          30 or 40£. bill to <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="secondary">London</placeName>, and must at last send to 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="indirect">Boston</placeName> for it, to defray my expences here,
          the Province is small and really poor, but the people deserve better, they have a just sense of 
          their duty to H.M., and it would be great favour to them to be 
          indulged in this petition, and it would give me a great deale of 
          pleasure to be an instrument of doing them any service, which 
          is all the reward I can expect ; I presume I need not tell my 
          Lords that there is no sallary but to ye chief Governour, and tho' 
          that is four times a proportion from this Province in respect to 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">ye Massachusets</placeName> one thousand pounds wch. is recomended to be 
          settled on a Governour, yet it is too inconsiderable for any 
          man's support but one of themselves. I am told the perquisites 
          are worth 40 or 50£. sterl. pr. annum ; since my arrival they 
          have not amounted to so many shillings this currency etc. 
          Proposes to return to <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="indirect">Fredericks Fort</placeName> for 2 or 3 months. " I 
          reckon that my home for tho' the gentlemen here are exceeding

          am obliged to lodge in a publique house, and the best of them 
          are bad in this country etc. PS. You will see by the letters 
          wch. has passed between Governour Belcher and me, and 
          which I now send to my brother to be communicated to my

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Duke of Newcastle. 
          Enclose following representation to be laid before the King. Annexed, 
          299. i. Same to the King. In obedience to your Majesty's 
          commands etc. (12th July), we have considered how 
          far the two Regiments in <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> may be useful 
          towards reduceing the rebellious negroes, or necessary 
          to be continued there, for the defence and security of 
          that island. These regiments we presume were 
          ordered upon this service in consequence of an humble 
          Address to your Majesty from the Govr. and Council 
          of Jamaica in Nov. 1730 etc. (v. C.S.P.) quoted. 
          Continue : By our last returns from Jamaica the 
          number of white people including men women and 
          children and indented servants was 7648, and the 
          number of black slaves 74,525 exclusive of the free 
          negroes who were then 865. But, since the fears 
          which the people of Jamaica entertained of a Spanish 
          invasion have been removed by the late conventions 
          between your Majesty and the Crown of Spain and, 
          as we have been informed that the regiments now in 
          Jamaica can be of no other use for the reduction of 
          the rebellious negroes than by keeping the black slaves 
          in order at home, whilst the militia of the country shall 
          be employ'd in hunting the former in the woods ; we 
          are humbly of opinion that your Majesty may be 
          pleased to withdraw one of those regiments at least, 
          if not both of them, especially as the people of Jamaica 
          are unwilling to contribute for any continuance to 
          their support. But on the other hand, if your Majesty 
          should approve of this proposal, we could wish the 
          same might be executed in such manner as not totally 
          to deprive this valuable island of a force which is at 
          present a considerable increase to the number of their 
          white inhabitants, and which seems in some sort           
          necessary for securing their domestick tranquility ; 
          wherefore we would humbly propose that the commanding 
          officers of both the said regiments should 
          receive your Majesty's instructions to disband not 
          only such of their soldiers as are artizans and may be 
          qualified to get their living, but in general all such as 
          shall meet with fitting encouragement for settling, 
          and shall be willing to stay in that country. The 
          remaining Regiment, if one shall remain, may next be 
          compleated to its full complement out of that proposed 
          to be reduced. And as the two Independent 
          Companies in Jamaica may reasonably be supposed 
          to be very weak, from the great charge that attends 
          recruiting in that island, we would also propose that 
          they might be filled up out of the said regiments, 
          whose officers may afterwards come home to raise 
          their companies again in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, by which means 
          the force of these regiments will still in great measure 
          be preserved to Jamaica, and your Majesty will save 
          the expence of bringing back the greatest part of the 
          soldiers from thence to <placeName ref="#gb" role="secondary">Great Britain</placeName>. With respect 
          to the negroes who have seated themselves in the 
          mountainous parts of Jamaica, we beg leave to acquaint 
          your Majesty, that we have reason to believe, that 
          some of them are descended from the negroes left 
          there by the Spaniards, when the English first 
          possessed themselves of this island, and that their 
          numbers have since been considerably encreased by 
          those that have from time to time deserted from your 
          Majesty's subjects. They are by some accounts 
          supposed to be about 500 men able to bear arms, 
          but what their positive number may be we cannot 
          determine. Heretofore when they have been
          troublesome by their incursions amongst the outward 
          settlements at Jamaica, the usual method was for the 
          Governor to contract with the King of the Musquitos 
          for a party of his subjects to hunt them in the woods, 
          but we are informed that when the King of that 
          nation was last at Jamaica, he was sent home 
          dissatisfied with the usage he received there, which 
          may possibly be the reason why the people of Jamaica 
          have not applyed to him upon this occasion. But as 
          the reduction or expulsion of these runaway negroes 
          is absolutely necessary for the peace and settlement 
          of Jamaica, we would humbly propose, that your 
          Majesty's Governor of Jamaica should be instructed to 
          try if by methods of lenity and good usage they may not 
          be brought into your Majesty's obedience, in which case 
          a proper tract of land may be allotted them in Jamaica 
          for their habitation ; but if this should be found 
          impracticable or dangerous, and the island should be 
          destitute of a sufficient force to reduce them, that 
          then the Governor should endeavour to conclude a 
          treaty with them for their being transported to one of 
          the uninhabited <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">Bahama Islands</placeName>, or some other part of 
          your Majesty's Dominions in <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">America</placeName>, where they might 
          settle under proper regulations, and in time become 
          good subjects to your Majesty, and useful to the 
          publick. Autograph signatures. Paper seal on report.

          Lt. Governor Dunbar to Mr. Popple. By letters from 
          my brother I understand that Governour Belcher's friends deny 
          that any force was sent down or any jurisdiction exercised by 
          his order at <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Fredericksfort</placeName>, it is notorious that every child in 
          this country knows it etc. Refers to enclosures. Continues : 
          It is no wonder they can deny matters of fact, when it 
          is courantly reported and believ'd here that Collo. Tailer and 
          the Committee sent by Mr. Belcher to ask improper questions 
          at Fredericksfort, were onely putt in there by stress of weather 
          etc. It would be hard to give a general bad character of any 
          country, but I will say that I never knew truth less regarded 
          any where in my life than in <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="indirect">New England</placeName>, (I comonly mean 
          by that, <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Masachusets province</placeName> onely) etc. My brother gave 
          me hopes that my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty would 
          have sent a new commission for a Judge of Vice- Admiralty for 
          the Masachusets instead of Mr. Byfield before whom, experience 
          has convinced me, it is to no purpose to exhibit any libell. I 
          took the liberty formerly to say it was very inconvenient to 
          have the Admiralty Court officers here onely Depty. to those 
          at <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="indirect">Boston</placeName>, and it would be great
          care to the people of <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">Maine</placeName>, 
          if anything relating to them in that Court, could be tryed <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">here</placeName> 
          without goeing 60 miles farther to Boston, it would be a very 
          great conveniency to me and my Deputys, as all the pine trees 
          are in <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="secondary">New Hampshire</placeName> and Maine. Pray commend this to my 
          Lords for the opinion and intercession for such commission for 
          George Jaffrey, now Deputy Judge of Vice Admiralty here.

          Lt. Governor Dunbar to the Duke of Newcastle. Has 
          received H.M. Commission to be Lt. Governor, and is very 
          sensible of his unworthiness of so high a trust, but "will do 
          my best endeavours to doe it like an honest man " etc. Returns 
          thanks for his Grace's support when so much opposition was 
          made to it etc. Continues : Your Grace will be more and 
          more sensible every day that the interest formed against me, 
          was the same that opposes everything relateing to H.M. and 
          His interest in ye <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Masachusets</placeName> Governmt. If I had been less 
          diligent in my duty in <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">America</placeName>, I should have had more friends 
          and more mony too etc. My enemies have stuck at nothing 
          to blacken my character with your Grace, they are in that 
          respect not unlike the papists who are of opinion they may use 
          all ways and means to promote their own interest and keep 
          no faith with hereticks, such, my Lord, are all those that differ 
          from the Masachusets principles, in their opinion ; dayly 
          demonstration evinces it, they deny facts upon public record. 
          One instance was that they never sent any force to disturb 
          the settlements at and near <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Fredericksfort</placeName>, when in fact a 
          High Sheriff was sent, who is also Major of a regiment in the 
          <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">Province of Maine</placeName>, with an armed sloop and 36 men in arms 
          to take prisoners from thence, and effected it, and some of the 
          men to this day in ye county gaol of that province, more than 
          100 miles from the place where they were taken. I had ye 
          honour some time agoe to give a full account hereof to your 
          Grace and to my Lords Commissioners for Trade etc., but there 
          has been such tricks play'd with my letters both to as well as 
          from <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, that many have miscarryed both ways, it is 
          pretty common at <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="indirect">Boston</placeName>, and even Governour Belcher (under 
          whose command I now am) has deigned to be so far concerned 
          yt. way that H.E. has even handed copys about of one letter 
          from my wife to me ; this, may it please your Grace is a heavy 
          charge against a man yt. ought to be a Gentleman. I have had 
          the honour of writeing often to your Grace, and if I fail to prove 
          any one particular as I represent it, I can expect no other but 
          a scandalous dismission from H.M. service and to be abandoned 
          by all men of honour ; until then I most humbly beg your Grace 
          not to believe anything yt. may be suggested to my discredt. 
          until I have an oppertunity of justifying myself. I have now 
          sent accounts of the new settlements, of wt. relates to 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">this Province</placeName> to my Lords Comms. for Trade, and requested yt. 
          copys may be layd before your Grace. I have no clerk or

          took up a vessel and enlisted upwards of 30 men, well

          got as many as he wanted, and secured them on board. 
          He said he was not limited to any certain number of

        <p>306. i. Replies to Queries of 20th June, 1729. Same as 
          Jan. 11, 1730, q.v., with alterations, (i) There are 
          65 vessels, the biggest not exceeding 120 tons ; (ii) 
          British and East India goods were about two years 
          since imported directly from <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName> in some of the 
          <placeName ref="#bm" role="direct">Bermuda</placeName> vessels, but have for several months past 
          been imported by the way of <placeName ref="#bb" role="indirect">Barbadoes</placeName>, which is all

          No. of inhabitants, White, 4,353 ; Blacks, 3,248. (ix) 
          They are decreased within these two years 1,173, the 
          chiefest reasons whereof are that the inhabitants daily 
          remove their familys to other Colonys for their better 
          support, and the blacks are often transported, (x) 
          Militia, 509, besides officers, (xi) The fortifications 
          are now almost repaired, (xvi) Finding that the 
          sums raised for defraying the charges of repairing 
          the fortifications were not sufficient, the act supra 
          (No. ii) has been lately made etc. Endorsed, Recd,

          Mr. Delafaye to Mr. Popple. Begs pardon for not 
          answering sooner his letter relating to Act of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName>
          for the better regulating slaves etc. and return thanks for notice of Mr. 
          Williams' memorial. The reason for his delay was that his 
          agency for Jamaica expired last March. " I had left my papers 
          relating to it in town, and I was obliged to send for them to 
          look them over, which the multiplicity of business and the 
          hurry we have had here has hindred me from doing " etc. 
          Has written twice to Governor Hunter for his reasons for passing 
          the act, but not heard from him. But it appears from the act 
          itself and his letter to the Board, 10th May, 1730, " that the 
          intent of the act was cheifly to prevent the rebellious negroes 
          from mixing among the other inhabitants of Jamaica, 
          frequenting their markets, trading with them and being supply ed 
          with arms and ammunition. Whether those rebels, provoked 
          by the attempts that have been made against them and not 
          subdued, but rather elated with the ill success of those attempts, 
          are less dangerous now than they were when that act was past, 
          or whether the act itself was a proper method of cutting them 
          off in some measure from the advantages of commerce and 
          from the opportunities of being supported in their rebellion is 
          what I must humbly submit to their Lops.' better judgement. 
          As this regards the publick good and even the safety of the 
          island, it seems in my humble opinion to deserve attention in 
          the first place. Mr. Williams's case and that of other free 
          negroes who are men of substance, if there be any more such, 
          does also deserve consideration, and I must own that as it is 
          stated it appears to be a hard one ; for which reason I cannot 
          desire that the act should be confirmed unless Major Genl. 
          Hunter should send over such reasons for it as may convince 
          their Lops, of the justice and necessity of it ; But till I hear 
          from him, I humbly begg their Lops, will be so good as to 
          suspend the rejecting of the act. I hope that upon what I 
          have wTitten to Mr. Hunter, the law will not have been put 
          in execution so as to prejudice Mr. Williams, or any others in 
          like case, and that some act will have been past for taking off 
          whatever may be too severe against persons in those circum- 
          stances. If I do not in a reasonable time receive from Jamaica 
          a satisfactory explanation of this matter, the loss of the act 
          (if they think it a good one) must be imputed to themselves, 
          etc. Signed, Ch. Delafaye. Endorsed, Recd. 17th, Read 20th

          Lt. Governor Gooch to the Duke of Newcastle. The 
          course of trade from hence to <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName> affording me now a 
          convenient oppertunity to convey to your Grace the journals 
          of Council and other publick papers of this Government for the 
          last year, it is with pleasure that I can inform your Grace, that 
          as no extraordinary event has happened to disturb the public 
          tranquility, so there will be found nothing in the journals to 
          shew any other than a perfect harmony in the Government, 
          and a general satisfaction amongst the people. Providence 
          hath hitherto favoured this Colony with the greatest prospect 
          of a plentiful crop of all the usual productions of the earth than 
          hath been known for many years, particularly that of tobacco ; 
          and if I could be so happy as to have H.M. approbation of the 
          late act for amending the staple of tobacco, I have certain hopes 
          not only of seeing a new life to this lately lanquishing trade by 
          advancing the reputation of <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> tobacco both at home 
          and abroad, but also a very considerable increase of H.M. 
          Customs. As this act hath no other meaning than doing justice 
          to the Crown, meliorating the quality of our staple commodity, 
          and establishing an honest method of dealing between the buyer 
          and the seller, I need use no other arguments to engage your 
          Grace's favourable recommendation of it, and therefore shall 
          only add, that whilst it remains uncertain whether it is to have 
          continuance or not for the four years it is intended to be in 
          force the minds of the people will be kept still wavering and 
          the due execution of the measures thereby established thence 
          greatly discouraged, which makes me, with the great charge 
          the country hath been at, the more sollicitous for its speedy 
          confirmation. I have one thing more to trouble your Grace 
          with. It is to have the opinion of H.M. Attorney and Sollicitor 
          General etc., whether slaves, Christians or not, convicted in the 
          Plantations of such crimes as by the laws of <placeName ref="#en" role="descriptive">England</placeName> are within 
          the benefit of Clergy, are intitled to the priviledge of the statutes 
          of England concerning Clergy. The case as it is stated here by 
          our lawyers, I have ordered our Agent Mr. Leheup to wait on 
          your Grace with etc. Signed, William Gooch. Endorsed, R.

          at other plantations than those to which they belong 
          and punishing such as shall assemble together, great

          grace the melancholly account of the death of Collo. Montgomerie, 
          our late Governour ; he dyed suddainly at <placeName ref="#us_ny_newyork" role="direct">New York</placeName>
          about foure of the clock on thursday morning the first of this 
          month ; some say of an appolectick fit, some say the gout with 
          which he had been for some time before afflicted got into his 
          stomach and carried him off etc. He was buried on fryday 
          evening, on Saturday I received the scales and papers relating 
          to this Province and immediately repaired to it, but it being 
          the heigth of harvest here and the gentlemen of H.M. councill 
          living verry remote from each other I could not get a councill 
          together till the wedensday and then but foure of them besides 
          myselfe ; when I took the oathes usuall on such an occasion ; 
          and at the desire of that councill summoned another to meet at 
          this place on the 16th pass'd. the inclosed addresse or memoriall 
          to me which they desire me to lay before your Grace, is what I 
          believe they chiefly intended by that meeting, if I am rightly 
          informed, what is there said to me is the generall sence of the 
          whole or by much the greatest part of the Province, and the 
          truth of the matters of fact alleged by them consists with my 
          knowledge. If H.M. should be graciously inclined to comply 
          with their desires, I humbly submit whether it would be incon- 
          venient to call the Assembly together to try whether a suitable 
          support will be raised by them in case they should be indulged 
          with such a seperate governour ; which perhaps they may now 
          have verry vigorous resolutions to do in an ample manner, whilst 
          their desires are strong : and which may flagg when they are 
          gratified, the gentlemen of the Councill dwelling so remote 
          from each other ; and all but two from this place it is not easie 
          to get a majority of them together. I find there are verry many 
          officers both civill and military wanting which I shal try to 
          supply in the best manner I can agreably to H.M. instructions

        <p>309. i. Address of the Council of <placeName ref="#us_nj" role="direct">New Jersey</placeName> to Lewis Morris, 
          President of the Council. <placeName ref="#us_nj_perthamboy" role="from">Perth Amboy</placeName>,
          July 18, 1731. Whilst expressing concern at the death of 
          Governor Montgomerie, congratulate him upon his 
          accession to the Government, and promise their 
          support. Continue : " If his Majesty shall not think 
          it inconsistant with his service to suffer it to be longer 
          than is usual on such occasions, we shall esteem it as 
          a great instance of H.M. royall goodness and favour 
          unto this Province. Tho' the late Governour was 
          pleased to dispence with your attendance during the 
          setting of the last Assembly so that you were not 
          present at the many debates that then were concerning 
          the government of this Province by a Governor 
          seperate and distinct from <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="direct">New York</placeName> etc., which (by 
          the consent of the late Governour) at last ended in 
          an address to H.M. etc. (v. 4th June). Yet the know- 
          ledge you have of the nature and circumstances of this 
          Province and the long experience you have had of the 
          methods of Government both before and since the 
          surrender of it to the Crown (you having been nigh 
          fourty years concerned in it and for the most part at 
          the head of the Council during that time) makes it 
          impossible for you to be unacquainted with the reasons 
          which induced the Assembly to make that address 
          etc. The generall Proprietors did upon their surrender 
          of the Government in 1702 concieve they were in some 
          measure intitled to have a distinct Governour etc., 
          and the making the same person Governour of New 
          York etc. being destructive of their interest, they 
          understood that a distinct Governour was to be 
          appointed and flattered themselves with the hopes of 
          it. And if we are not misinformed, a person was by 
          the then Queen named for that purpose : But the Lord 
          Cornbury who had been some time before appointed 
          Governour of New York (and who had then actually 
          departed the Kingdom with a commission for 
          Governour of New York only) did by the intrest of his 
          friends at Court prevail on the Queen to alter her 
          intentions in that point and obtained letters patent 
          constituting him Governour of this Province also. 
          The inhabitants soon found the ill effects that was 
          the consequence etc. and the then Assembly by their 
          remonstrance to him represented the inconveniency 
          of his long absence and residence in New York etc., 
          but their complaints on that head, however reasonable 
          have not been hitherto attended with the desired 
          success, nor indeed have we any room to hope that 
          any person Governour of New York supported by the 
          large sallary and numerous perquisites of that government
          with a garrison at his command and a sumptuous 
          habitation provided by H.M. for his residence with 
          ease and splendour will be easily prevailed upon to 
          have so much self denyall as to reside for any 
          considerable time amongst us who have not great 
          conveniencies for his reception and whose coming 
          into this Province is not only attended with an expence 
          to himself but a hazard of suffering some loss by his 
          absence from New York. But however convenient 
          the Governour's residence in New York may be to 
          himself and however imaginary the supposing of him 
          verry much under the influence of the Councills of 
          that Province to the prejudice of this may be deemed 
          to, be yet that the almost constant residence of the 
          Chief Magistrate of any country out of the country to 
          be governed by him has been and alwaies will be 
          inconvenient and prejudiciall to that country we 
          take to be self-evident etc. It is but too notorious a 
          truth that the residence of the Governours of this 
          Province in New York and their necessary application 
          to the affairs of that Province have to often occasioned 
          almost an intire neglect or forgetfulness of the concerns 
          of this and when offices of the Government have 
          become vacant they have been often suffered to 
          continue so for a long time or filled with persons unfit 
          for them to the great hurt of the country which we 
          perswade ourselves would have been otherwise had the 
          Governours been upon the spot and taken the advice 
          of the Council here who dwelling in severall parts 
          of the Province must be better acquainted with 
          both men and things then a Governour residing in 
          New York can probably be, it is no difficult task to 
          multiply instances of this kind, few of the commissions 
          either civil or military having been renewed by the 
          late Governour, and some not since the accession of 
          his present Majesty etc., whereby severall of the Courts 
          of Justice have with great difficulty been kept up and 
          the militia in most places remaind undisciplined which 
          in case of an invasion may be of bad consequence. 
          The Governour's attending on the affairs of New York 
          hath made it convenient for him to summon the Council 
          to attend him in a part of the Province verry remote 
          from their habitations that his meeting with them 
          might be with the greatest ease to himself but at the 
          same time could not be done by them but with great 
          fatigue as well as an extraordinary expence and often 
          when the publick affairs of the Province make 
          applications to the Governour necessary, such is the 
          inclemency of the weather in the winter season that 
          it is not seldom verry difficult and dangerous to apply 
          to him at New York but some times altogether 
          impracticable. The Governour's being absent for a 
          year and oftener for six months has been the occasion 
          of great delays in the administration of justice both 
          in causes depending in Chancery and in those before 
          the Governours and Council on write of error to the 
          great impoverishing of the parties etc., who have been 
          necessitated in order to expedite their business to 
          consent to hearing in Chancery at the <placeName ref="#us_ny_newyork" role="direct">City of New York</placeName>
          where at a great expence and loss of time they 
          have attended with their Council for that purpose and 
          in cases of appeals by writs of error which lye before 
          the Governour and Council has been in this Province 
          so seldom is a means of protracting those causes to 
          such an extraordinary length as almost amounts to 
          a deny all of justice and renders the judgment on which 
          such appeals are brought in a manner altogether 
          ineffectual. The Governour's residence in the Province 
          of New York and expending in that place the sallary 
          raised by this Province gives a great discouragement 
          to the raising the necessary support of the Government 
          the inhabitants conceiving they are not without an 
          equitable pretence that the money raised by them 
          should circulate in this Province and not be exported 
          to another this they account in some measure 
          detrimental to their trade which being but small is the 
          less able to bear any discouragement. Sir, as His 
          Majesty is the common parent of all his subjects who 
          are how farr soever remote from his royall person 
          equally the objects of his care and tenderness, so we 
          natter ourselves that when he is informed how 
          inconvenient and detrimentall it is to this Province how 
          prejudiciall to his service to have the same person 
          Governour etc., his royal goodness will be induced to 
          commissionate some person to be Governor different 
          and distinct from the Governor of New York etc., and 
          we pray that you would be pleased to lay before one 
          of His Majesty's principall Secretaries of State what 
          has been said to you on this head. Signed, John 
          Anderson, John Hamilton, John Parker, John Johnston junr.,

          of 24th Feb. and encloses list of acts passed last session. 
          Continues : That which enacts the additional subsistance for 
          the two regiments for six months longer, that is to say twelve 
          months from their landing, was carried with great strugle but 
          by the majority of one vote, so God alone knows what must 
          become of them when that time is expired. I am at present 
          busied in fitting and ordering out a party consisting of four 
          companys of the regular troops at <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, fourscoure armed 
          negroes and fourscore baggage by the advice of the Council, 
          in conformity to an Act pass'd last Session to march against 
          <placeName ref="#jm_nannytown" role="direct">the slaves in rebellion in the North East parts</placeName>, but the wheels 
          of this machin move so heavily, and the levys go on so awkwardly 
          that I have but little hopes of any great feats to be done this 
          bout. Neither I nor any belonging to me have any lands at 
          Port Antonio. In the beginning of the settlement I did put 
          my children's names in some patents for the encouragement of 
          others, but upon the landing of the troops I sold my negroes 
          and abandon'd the grants which was always my intention when 
          the place was once secured, as everybody here with whom I 
          conversed intimately well knew. Your cousin Henderson who

          Mr. Popple to Mr. Scrope. Having laid before my 
          Lords Commrs. your letter of 4th June, inclosing two from 
          Mr. Worseley, relating to the arrears due in Barbados, upon 
          an act for supporting the honour and dignity of the Government ; 
          I am commanded to desire, you will please to acquaint 
          the Lords Commrs. of the Treasury, that as the people of 
          <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">Barbados</placeName> have alledged that they have by the said act made 
          a much larger provision for their Governor than they are able 
          to bear, frequent disputes have arisen between him and them 
          upon that subject ; and they have endeavoured to avoid the 
          force of the said law : However, if the law be sufficient for the 
          purposes for which it was intended (as the Govr. seems to 
          apprehend it is) he has it in his power to put the same 
          in execution ; and my Lords Commrs. do not apprehend it 
          necessary that the Royal authority should interpose between 
          the Govt. and the People upon this occasion. [C.O. 29, 15, pp. 228, 229.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Governor 
          Montgomerie. Abstract. Acknowledge letters etc. of 22nd May 
          and 21st Dec. Have discoursed with several <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="direct">New York</placeName> 
          merchants about the trading-house at <placeName ref="#us_ny_oswego" role="direct">Oswego</placeName>, who propose 
          a duty on furs payable at <placeName ref="#us_ny_albany" role="direct">Albany</placeName> might be a very proper fund 
          for that charge. The Board inclines to a license to be paid 
          by any one who wishes to trade with the Indians, which must 
          be no greater than is required for that service. Are surprized 
          that the Assembly should not contribute cheerfully to the 
          support of this trading house. The Act for laying such a duty 
          must have a suspensory clause. They hope the Assembly in 
          the mean time will continue their present provision for the 
          trading house. They have cancelled all that he has written 
          about the paper currency of <placeName ref="#us_nj" role="direct">New Jersey</placeName>. It was only an 
          account of the many and cautious provisions for sinking the 
          bills and preventing deficiencies, that they have allowed the 
          Act for creating 40,000£ in paper currency lie by. It is not to 
          be imagined, therefore, that they can give up any one of them. 
          No harm can be done if the bills should be sunk in less time than 
          that allowed by the Act. If, as he mentions, the Assembly 
          refuse to assist at the sinking of these interest bills, as is required 
          by the law, they must be answerable for the consequence. 
          Having therefore often desired that he would propose to the 
          Assembly the passing an act to repeal that for appropriating a 
          part of the interest money paid into the Treasury, etc. to the incidental 
          charges of the Government etc., as the Assembly dont think proper 
          to comply, that have laid this act before H.M. for his disallow- 
          ance etc. Will be cautious how they lay the act last passed 
          for creating 20,000£. more in paper bills before H.M. for his 
          confirmation, considering how ready the Assembly are to break 
          into their own appropriations. [C.0. 5, 1125. pp. 172-176.

          Governor Osborn to the Duke of Newcastle. Has 
          little to add to his letter of 25th Sept. last, but what would appear 
          a repetition of it. Continues : No sooner was I arrived this year at 
          <placeName ref="#ca_nl_stjohns" role="direct">St. Johns</placeName> but I received a petition from the Justices of 
          the Peace of that district, setting forth the many obstructions

          general complaint of all those majestrates in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">this Island</placeName>, in 
          several parts of which they are in a manner already rendered 
          useless, transmits copy, with the orders I issued on that occasion 
          etc. With humble submission I presume by that, it will appear 
          to your Grace that the fishing Admirals, influenced by the rest 
          of the masters of the fishing ships, are the oposers of all the 
          steps that have been taken, and tho' I have only reproved 
          them for it ; yet I cant help saying they upon all occasions 
          behave themselves very dissrespectfully, and in our absence 
          treat H.M. authority and power with great contempt, and some 
          of them does not scruple to say, that it is their interrest to oppose 
          any form of Government whatever here, that is not established 
          by Parliament, and the reason is, by the Fishing Act, they 
          believe the administration of all affairs is in them, and that 
          they have thereby an unlimited power to do whatever they 
          please, and make use of it to serve any fraudulent purpose in 
          their private ways of trade, a great many of which, they could 
          not so well do, as while the power is in their hands ; these are 
          the arguments they make use of, and the real motives of their 
          dissentions etc. I have since with the humblest submission to 
          H.M. pleasure resined the Government to Capt. Clinton, and

          that authority from which we received it, and extend 
          the powers given them by the Act of Parliament to 
          all acts of Civil Government, and proceed therein in

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Refers to 
          letter of 12 and 13th respecting Col. Dunbar. Continues : 
          That gentleman seems to be in a perpetual ferment, and gives 
          me a great deal of unnecessary uneasiness, and I have reason 
          to believe is continually writing against me to the Board of 
          Trade etc. Asks that nothing may be done to his prejudice 
          till he has been served with copies for his answer etc., and that 
          Lt. Gov. Dunbar <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">[[ed. of New Hampshire]]</placeName> may be replaced by Mr. Sherburne.
          Continues : I have constantly transmitted the proceedings of the 
          Assembly of this Province which has been sitting ever since 
          26th May past, from which time there has not been a shilling 
          in the publick Treasury, for the support of the King's 
          Government and for the preservation and protection of H.M. good 
          subjects in this Province, nor will the Assembly make any 
          supply of money to the Treasury, unless it be in such a manner 
          as the King in his royal Instructions to me sayes is expressly 
          contrary to the tenour of the Charter etc. I am, may it please 
          your Grace, much concerned what will become of H.M. Province 
          of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, and earnestly desire the King's 
          special direction with respect to the supply of the Treasury, 
          for if the Assembly will not grant any money but in a manner 
          contrary to the King's orders to me, the Government will be 
          lost and the inhabitants great sufferers etc. Signed, J. Belcher. 2 pp. Enclosed,

        <p>Petition of several Merchants, Planters and others         
          interested in and trading to <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">Barbados</placeName> to the King. 
          Recount former regulations of Governor's salaries. 
          By means of the new Instruction and the influence 
          which all Governors must have from the greatness of 
          their power (which private men dont think it prudent 
          or safe to contend with), the present Governor 
          prevailed upon the Assembly to settle on him 6000£. 
          sterling pr. annum etc. As petitioners have found by 
          experience this additional Instruction tends greatly 
          to the endangering the peace and welfare of the island 
          and to the creating of animositys and divisions amongst 
          the planters and inhabitants etc., and to load their 
          plantations and products with heavy dutys to the 
          great prejudice and almost ruin of their trade. And 
          as petitioners humbly conceive that an ill use hath 
          been made of the power given by this Instruction 
          whereby the inhabitants have been greatly 
          impoverished and also disabled from providing for 
          their necessary defence and security in repairing the 
          fortifications etc., and apprehend that the same ill 
          use may be made again etc., pray that it may be discontinued, etc.

          upon such usefull manufacturys for their necessary cloathing 
          etc. as will prevent the sale of considerable quantitys of European

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Governor Hunter. 
          Acknowledge letters of 19th, 7th Nov., and 24th Dec., 1730, 
          23rd Jan., 11th Feb. and 2nd and 21st April last. Continues : 
          We are very glad to find you have set so good an example to 
          the Spaniards in the care you have taken of their persons mony 
          and effects on board the Spanish man of war stranded on 
          <placeName ref="#pedro_shoals" role="direct">Pedro shoals</placeName>; we hope they will thereby be induced to shew equal 
          justice and humanity, should any of our ships suffer the like 
          calamity on or near their coast. As to the affair of the rebellious 
          negroes, of which almost all your letters make mention, we are 
          surpriz'd to find that the parties sent out against them should 
          have miscarried, and that expeditions of that consequence 
          should have been entrusted to the conduct of unexperienced 
          commanders, because every defeat of those sent out against 
          the negroes, must naturally give their encouragement by 
          teaching them to feel their own strength ; and the arresting 
          the commander of the other party upon a trivial debt, and 
          thereby putting a stop to the expedition, seems to be an 
          infatuation in the people, if there is realy so much danger to 
          be apprehended from the runaway negroes, as you have repre- 
          sented to us. Upon this occasion we can't help mentioning 
          to you, the former custom used in <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> of employing the 
          Musketoe Indians in the pursuit of your rebellious negroes, 
          and we are at a loss to know why they have not lately been 
          employed upon the like occasion, unless it be for the reason of 
          which we have lately been informed, that the people of Jamaica 
          sent them away dissatisfyed the last time they were in their 
          service. We find by former books in our Office, that the 
          Musketoe Indians, upon the death of their King's always 
          presented their new chosen one, to the Governor of Jamaica, 
          for his approbation, as a mark of their dependance on the 
          Crown of Great Britain, but if our information is true, and the 
          Musketoes are realy discontented, it may be a means of loseing 
          their friendship. We therefore desire you will give us a distinct 
          account of this matter. We have constantly from time to 
          time, laid before His Majesty, such accounts as you have sent 
          to us of the state of your island with respect to the negroes in 
          rebellion, which was the occasion of sending the two regimts. 
          now with you ; We hope that so long as they shall be found 
          necessary to continue at Jamaica, the Assembly will provide 
          for them, and give them all reasonable accomodation. But we 
          are sorry to find by some late accounts from your parts, that 
          both officers and soldiers are in general in a bad state of health. 
          We have lately laid before H.M. a state of Jamaica with respect 
          to the runaway negroes and to the utility of the two regiments 
          there, and so soon as we shall know H.M. pleasure concerning 
          the same, you may expect to hear again from us upon this head. 
          However we must observe, that by the Assemblie's having made 
          provision for the said regiments but for six months, it would 
          seem they did not think the stay of these regiments of any 
          consequence to the island. We find by your letter of the 21st 
          of April last that your new Assembly was to meet the 4th of 
          May following, and we hope they will shew a better disposition, 
          and will more readily concur in measures for the advantage of 
          the island than their predecessors. We have not yet had time 
          throughly to form any judgment upon the last acts you 
          have sent us, but we apprehend some of them will be liable 
          to objections : the merchants of <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName>, 
          <placeName ref="#en_bristol" role="direct">Bristol</placeName> and <placeName ref="#en_liverpool" role="indirect">Liverpool</placeName> 
          have already petitioned agst. that for laying a duty on negroes, 
          and we can't help observing that you did very wrong to give 
          your consent to any act for laying an imposition of 100£. a head 
          on each convict imported for as it must in consequence take 
          away the effect of the law of <placeName ref="#gb" role="secondary">this Kingdom</placeName> for the transportation 
          of felons ; it was directly against your instructions. We are 
          likewise surpriz'd at your having pass'd the act for repealing 
          the Protestant act, which has been confirmed by H.M., and 
          that at your request : you have not omitted any solicitation 
          in behalf of it, by your agent and freinds ; you have represented 
          it to us as an act wherein the wellfare of Jamaica was highly 
          concern' d, and upon this account we were induced to propose 
          its confirmation, and one of the next laws you give your consent 
          to, is to repeal it. If the Protestant act is of so much conse- 
          quence to the wellfare of Jamaica, we can by no means give 
          our consent to the annulling of it. [C.O. 138, 17. pp. 330-335.]</p>

          Capt. Osborn to [? Mr. Popple]. Has little to add 
          but what would appear a repetition of his former accounts etc. 
          Continues : No sooner was I arrived this year at <placeName ref="#ca_nl_stjohns" role="direct">St. Johns</placeName> 
          but I received a petition from the Justices of the Peace of that 
          district, setting forth the many obstructions they still meet 
          with in their office ; and since, finding this to be the general 
          complaint of all those magistrates in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">this Island</placeName>, in several 
          parts of which they are in a manner rendered useless, I have 
          taken the liberty to transmit their Lordps. a coppie of the same, 
          together with the order I issued on that occasion etc. Continues : 
          I presume it will appear to their Lordps., that the Fishing 
          Admirals influenced by the rest of the masters of the fishing 
          ships, are the opposers of all the steps that have been taking, 
          and tho' I have only reproved them for it, yet I can't help saying 
          they upon all occasions behave themselves very disrespectfully, 
          and in our absence treat H.M. authority and power with great 
          contempt, and some of them do not scruple to say, that it is 
          their interest to oppose any form of Goverment whatever 
          (here) that is not established by Parliament, and the reason 
          is, by the Fishery act they believe the administration of all 
          affairs is in them, and that they have thereby an unlimitted 
          power to do whatever they please, and make use of it to serve 
          any fraudulent purpose in their private way of trade, a great 
          many of which they could not so well do, as while the power 
          is in their hands. These are the arguments they make use of, 
          and the real motives of their dissentions, and the most material 
          affair I have to recommend to their Lordps.' consideration. 
          The consiquence of these disorders I conseve is now grown so 
          notorious that offenders escape with impunety, and of what 
          consiquence it may be of to the trade, at a time when it is 
          manifest those offenders must increase, I can't say, since it is 
          now become a practice of the masters of ships, to bring over here 
          transported fellons instead of Irish servants ; an unhappy 
          instance of the villains that are here already happened laitly at 
          <placeName ref="#ca_nl_mosquito" role="direct">Muskitta</placeName>, in 
          <placeName ref="#by_conception" role="secondary">Conseption Bay</placeName>, where a wouman and four children 
          (being all in the house who could speak) were in a most barbarous 
          manner murdered in one night, and the committers of the fact 
          not yet found out. I have occasioned one man to be taken up 
          on suspition, but it's so slender, that if stronger does not appear 
          against him he must be released. I have since with the humblest 
          submission to H.M. pleasure resined the government to Capt.

          10th June, 1731. Have endeavoured to preserve peace in
          <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">the island</placeName>, and " lived very quiet and orderly till 
          the arrival of the Fishing Admirals and other masters 
          of ships in the several harbours " etc. Continue : 
          They since their arrival have very much contemned, 
          abused, and slighted our authority and that authority 
          from which we received it, and extend the powers 
          given them by the Act of Parliament etc., and proceed 
          therein in a very arbitrary manner, in somuch that 
          they have even presumed to create Constables and 
          also issue warrants to those appointed by us in our 
          Quarter Sessions to the createing great confusion in 
          those officers etc. Whereas they never attempted 
          anything like this before this Commission was estab- 
          lished, we humbly conceave there power is limitted 
          to the hearing and determining the rights and 
          properties of fishing rooms and such matters and 
          things as relate to the Fishery. We therefore humbly 
          desire to represent to your Excellency the affront and 
          dishonour done to H.M. by disputing the validity of 
          his Commission, the stop and interruption put to the 
          administration of publick Justice, and the contempt 
          and scorn shown both to us and our authority etc. 
          Pray for a full explanation of the Act of Parliament 
          etc. Cannot any longer sustain their office, unless a 
          public sanction be given to their proceedings, and a 
          stop put to the illegal practices of the Admirals etc.

          12th June, 1731. Whereas it has been represented 
          to me, that some troublesome, ill-designing people, 
          who through private and corrupt views have 
          endeavour'd to disturbe the minds of H.M. orderly 
          and well-disposed subjects etc., very much tending to 
          the subversion of all good order and Government etc., 
          by throwing scandalous and seditious reflections upon 
          H.M. authority and power, and particularly touching 
          those commissions granted by Him for the better 
          government of <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName>, under false interpriting 
          the power granted to Admirals by the Act of Parliament etc. ;
          and have been very industrious to deminish 
          the power and authority of H.M. Justices etc., these 
          are therefore strictly to require all and singular H.M. 
          subjects etc. to behave themselves with all due respect 
          and obedience to the Civil Government and the 
          majestrates thereof etc., as they would to those of the 
          same power and authority in <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Brittain</placeName>; and to 
          be aiding and assisting to them in keeping the peace 
          etc., as you will answer the contrary at your peril etc. 
          Concludes : And furthermore I do will and require 
          all H.M. Justices of the Peace, strictly to execute the 
          laws on such who shall show any contempt to their 
          authority or power ; or in any wise transgress against the laws of

          Governor Clinton to the Duke of Newcastle. This 
          is the first opportunity I have had since my arrival, which was 
          the 30th of June, of acquainting your Grace of it ; and of my 
          giving publick notice in the several ports of <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">my Government</placeName>,

          wind permits, to see the condition of that place, and as I find 
          it shall make an exact report of it to your Grace, and beg the 
          honour of your Grace's favour, and protection, in governing 
          this sett of people, which will be a very difficult task by what 
          Capt. Osborn tells me, and I find by some few complaints I have 
          already received of the Admirals' obstructing the Justices in 
          the civil power ; but shall take particular care of making up 
          all differences, as far as I am capable, and to be as little troublesome 
          as possible to your Grace. Signed, Geo. Clinton.

          Governor Clinton to [? Mr. Popple]. Announces his 
          arrival on 30th June. Continues : Nothing material has 
          happened since. The most cruel and barbarous murder that 
          has been committed at <placeName ref="#ca_nl_mosquito" role="direct">Muskitta</placeName>, I leave to Capt. Osborn to 
          give an account of etc., but have made all the enquiry since, 
          I have been capable of, to no purpose etc. I design sailing for 
          <placeName ref="#ca_nl_placentia" role="direct">Placentia</placeName> to-morrow etc., and in my way back to call in at 
          <placeName ref="#ca_nl_caplinbay" role="direct">Capling Bay</placeName>, to decide 
          what disputes may happen at <placeName ref="#ca_nl_ferryland" role="direct">Ferryland</placeName> 
          (if it's possible). For by what Capt. Osborn has been so good to 
          acquaint me with, and let me into, I think it will be a very 
          difficult task, by the obstructions the Justices and the civil 
          power meet with from the Admirals, by their taking upon them 
          much more privilege than the Act directs etc. Refers to enclosure. 
          Continues : That Joel Davies was a vain silly fellow, and had 
          no ship, which with humble submission to their Lordps. made 
          it worse, but he is since dead. I shall just give a small account 
          of the Fishery as it stands at present, being not very skillful 
          of their affairs as yet etc. We have great quantities of Bank 
          fish this year, even greater than has been known for these three 
          years last past, but the boat fishing is very bad, everybody 
          complaining, and I am afraid will break several young beginers, 
          there being several new flakes and stages built ; what there 
          is I beleive will turn out very good etc., by the fair weather there 
          has been this month to make it in. The price is not broke yet, 
          but it's guess'd about 28 reals the quintal etc. Signed, Geo. Clinton.

          to that gentleman's complaint against him, which will leave

          that my presence at the examination should have any influence

          Attorney there, applyed to me lately to have the oaths to his

          think that he ought to countenance his acting as 
          Judge of the Admiralty, he having neglected to qualify 
          himself by taking the oaths to his present Majesty, 
          as did all other officers in the Government upon the 
          demise of the late King, and although he had an 
          opportunity of renewing his Commission in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, 
          having returned without credentials. Besides the 
          enquiries by Mr. Secretary Burchet, 25th March, 
          1729, as to the Vice-Admiralty Court there, whilst 
          Mr. Browne was in England, seem to indicate that 
          the Lords Commrs. did not intend to direct a 
          new Commission to him etc. Does not see how he 
          can pretend to hold a Court, the Register declining 
          to act under him, for reasons best known to himself, 
          and no Marshal or Advocate having been appointed 
          from home. But as he has a complaint against the 
          Lt. Governor depending against him, he will await 
          its determination before interesting himself in his 
          officiating as Judge of the Vice Admiralty Court etc.

          was read ; the Lords being humbly of opinion that this consideration, 
          with relation to the sending away those Regiments 
          from thence, depends, in a great measure, upon the strength 
          and force of the Independant Companies remaining there, and 
          the probability of success of the methods proposed by the Board 
          of Trade for settling such of the soldiers as shall be willing to 
          remain in the Island, their Lordps. would humbly propose that 
          this matter should be referred to the Board of Trade to explain 
          in what manner that may be done and what particular encouragement 
          should be given to the soldiers to settle there. The Lords observing 
          by Mr. Keen's letters that the Govrs. of <placeName ref="#do" role="indirect">St. Domingo</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#pr" role="indirect">Porto Rico</placeName> were removed and sent for home 
          to answer to complaints, and that the strictest orders were 
          sending to the Spanish Governors in the <placeName ref="#indies" role="direct">West Indies</placeName> to 
          prevent depredations, their Lordps. humbly conceive that 
          it is unnecessary to send any new directions to R. 
          Admiral Stewart upon that head. The report of the 
          Advocate, the Attorney and the Solicitor General upon Mr. 
          Bonham's petition, was read ; their Lops, think that a particular 
          letter should be wrote to Mr. Keene upon it, and upon the 
          petition of Story King ; and that Mr. Bonham should be told, 
          that it being not clear by above reports that he is intitled to 
          reprizals, and the situation of affairs at the Court of <placeName ref="#es" role="indirect">Spain</placeName>

          <placeName ref="#bs_nassau" role="direct">the fort</placeName>, and have made upwards of twenty new carriages for

          can towards the fortifications as soon as the heat of the summer 
          is over that I can put the garrison to work again without

          what I can do in a new Assembly tho' I fear little publick good 
          is to be expected from them if Mr. Colebrooke and his 
          accomplices here can have any influence to prevent the people's 
          working, they being too poor to contribute anything worth 
          collecting in money. I beg your Lordships' protection against 
          whatever is pretended to my disadvantage here till I can reply,

        <p>Mr. Fane to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Report upon 4 acts of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName>, (i) There is a clause in the 
          act for raising money laying a duty of 100£. a head upon all 
          convicts imported into Jamaica except such slaves as are 
          ordered transportation by two Justices of Peace and three 
          Freeholders for misdemeanours. The intention of which clause 
          seems to be to take away the force of a law passed here in the 
          fourth year of the late King which extended to all the Plantations 
          for the further preventing robbery, burglary and other felonys 
          and for the more effectual transportation of felons. For the 
          duty laid by this act upon the importer is so excessive that it 
          will amount to a totall prohibition of importing any felon into 
          Jamaica which the Judges and Justices here are impowered by 
          the said act to direct etc. An attempt of this kind was made in 
          <placeName ref="#us_va" role="indirect">Virginia</placeName> in 1722 by an act amending an act concerning servants 
          and slaves etc., which act etc. was repealed. This act is lyable 
          to the same objections and therefore I must submit etc., whether 
          it is fit to be passed, 1st as it is making ineffectual a law passed 
          here of great importance, to the property of the subjects of this 
          Kingdom, secondly as it is destructive of the duty and regard 
          which this island ought to shew to <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">her Mother-Country</placeName> etc. 
          There is also by this law a very high duty laid upon the 
          importation and exportation of negroes ; a practice in other 
          Colonies much discountenanced by your Lordships, as it is 
          passed in breach of the Governour's Instructions and highly 
          detrimental to the Trade and Navigation of this Kingdom etc. 
          Has no objection to the other three laws, for raising several sums 
          etc. ; for raising a tax by the poll etc. and the Deficiency Act.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Committee of 
          Privy Council. In pursuance of order of Aug. 4th, have 
          considered petition of Mr. Belcher jr. Continue : Altho' 
          we cannot reflect without concern, upon the obstinacy with wch. ye 
          General Assembly <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">[[ed. of Massachusetts]]</placeName> persist in their 
          refusal to settle a fix'd salary upon their Governor for the time being : yet 
          considering that the present Governor must necessarily have 
          been at large expence out of his private fortune since his entrance 
          upon that employmt. : as he has hitherto paid an exact 
          obedience to H.M. commands, by refusing to accept of any 
          salary contrary to the tenour of his Instructions, and as his 
          family must unavoidably be very great sufferers should be 
          left to support ye dignity of his station out of his private fortune ; 
          we are therefore humbly of opinion, that for this time only, 
          H.M. may be graciously pleased to permit Governor Belcher 
          to give his assent to ye aforesaid bill, as a particular grace and 
          favour to ye said Governor, and his family, and in consideration 
          of his faithful adherence to H.M. commands, provided nevertheless 
          that this condesention on the part of the Crown, shall 
          not in anywise be drawn into president for the future, nor be 
          in any degree construed to enervate the validity of H.M. former 
          Instructions upon this head, which Mr. Belcher should at ye 
          same time be commanded to inforce, by requiring ye Genl. 
          Assembly to settle his salary for ye future, in such manner as 
          may be most conformable to H.M. royal pleasure. Should yor. 
          Lordships concur with us in this opinion, we conceive that H.M. 
          permission to pass the aforesaid bill may be signify'd to Governor 
          Belcher by ye annexed Instruction, which we have drawn up 
          pursuant to yor. Lordships' order, and in conformity to the 
          sentiments we have conceive[d] upon this matter. Annexed, 
          350. i. Draft of H.M. Additional Instruction to Governor 
          Belcher. (Approved 12th Aug., 1731). Having 
          strictly adhered to the tenour of his Instructions in 
          refusing to accept any sum from the Assembly upon 
          terms contrary thereto, he is empowered to assent 
          to the bill of 8th June, for granting 5,400£. or the support 
          of H.M. Governor, " provided nevertheless, and it We 
          do hereby expressly declare, that it is not Our 
          intention thereby to enervate, or in any wise to 
          invalidate or take from the force of Our 27th 
          Instruction for fixing a settled salary upon Our 
          Governors, etc., and you are hereby required to 
          recommend the same again to the said Assembly in 
          the strongest terms, as the only manner that can be 
          acceptable to us." [C.O. 5, 916. pp. 426-431.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Duke of Newcastle. 
          Enclose following to be laid before the King. Annexed,
          351. i. Same to the King. In obedience to H.M. commands 
          of 3rd inst., represent that, Altho' nothing be more 
          evident to us than the necessity and good policy of 
          preserving the force of the said regiments to the 
          island of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> by such a reduction as we had the 
          honour to propose etc. (v. 15th July), yet it would be 
          extreamly difficult for us who are at so great a distance 
          to enter minutely into the detail of all that may be 
          requisite for the due execution of our proposal, which 
          must necessarily depend upon various circumstances, 
          only to be known with certainty by those who reside 
          at Jamaica, and are personally acquainted with that 
          country. We beg leave however to represent in 
          general to your Majesty, after having discoursed with 
          some gentlemen well acquainted with the scituation 
          and circumstances of Jamaica, that for many years 
          past there hath not been so good an opportunity as 
          this of encreasing the number of white people in 
          Jamaica nor may such another present itself for 
          some time to come. All the encouragements which 
          either your Majesty's Royal Predecessors or the 
          Legislature of Jamaica have at any time proposed 
          for peopling that island, which from its great extent 
          is capable of supporting a multitude of inhabitants, 
          being 150 miles in length and about 60 in breadth, 
          have hitherto been frustrated by the apprehensions 
          entertained of the rebellious negroes, because no way 
          could be found to make such a settlement as should 
          in its infancy be powerful enough to resist their 
          attempts. It is highly probable therefore, that 
          should your Majesty resolve to disband these regiments, 
          the Council and Assembly of Jamaica will heartily 
          concur in everything that may tend to confirm and 
          improve so great a benefit to their country, by 
          furnishing the soldiers with such utensils and 
          necessaries as may be proper for their establishments : 
          and this may be relied upon with the greater certainty, 
          because the charge arising to the people of Jamaica 
          by fitting out parties to reduce the rebellious negroes 
          is no less at present than 6000£. per ann., and the 
          additional subsistence which they contribute towards 
          the support of the two regiments amounts at least to 
          10,000£. etc., all which would be saved for the future 
          by making a right use of this opportunity to encrease 
          the number of their white inhabitants at a moderate 
          expence, by which means they may in time become 
          superior either to their foreign or domestick enemies, 
          and the charge of transporting the soldiers back to 
          <placeName ref="#europe" role="direct">Europe</placeName> will be saved to your Majesty.
          The only caution that seems requisite in the conduct of this 
          matter is, that the Governor of Jamaica should be 
          instructed not to disband the soldiers, before the 
          Council and Assembly have provided for their 
          establishment, and shall have actually settled them to 
          their satisfaction : and as it appears by accounts we 
          have received from Jamaica, that in the last expedition
          against the rebellious negroes, they were dispossessed of 
          <placeName ref="#jm_nannytown" role="direct">a considerable tract of land of near a mile square</placeName>, 
          well planted with provisions situated 
          in a country that abounds with wild hogs, fish and 
          fowl ; this would seem to us to be the properest place 
          for the reception of the soldiers, as well on account 
          of the plenty of provisions so necessary for the support 
          of new-comers, as because a strong settlement in that 
          part of the country would in a short time become a 
          frontier of great security to the rest of the neighbourhood, 
          be a great encouragement to other people to 
          settle near them, and very much straiten the negroes 
          in their present fastnesses, could not fail to incline 
          them to embrace with greater readiness such proposals 
          as may be made for their removal, if it should be 
          found either impracticable or dangerous to attempt 
          to reduce them to your Majesty's obedience in Jamaica, 
          by force, in which case we would most humbly offer 
          agreeable to what we have had the honour already 
          to propose to your Majesty, that the Govr. should be 
          instructed to enter into a treaty with them for their being transported to some 
          <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="direct">one of your Majesty's uninhabited islands in America</placeName>.    
          Upon the whole if your Majesty should be pleased to reduce the sd. 
          regiments at Jamaica, after filling up the two 
          Independant Companies there, we humbly conceive 
          that your royal orders should be issued to the 
          Governor for putting the same in execution in 
          such manner as shall be most agreeable to the 
          sentiments of the Council and Assembly there for 
          the security of the said island and for obtaining the 
          ends which your Majesty proposes thereby, it being 
          always understood as aforesaid that the Governor 
          should not disband the soldiers before the Council 
          and Assembly have made an adequate provision for 
          their settlement. And if your Majesty upon 
          disbanding the said regiments or either of them would 
          be graciously pleased to allow the soldiers to keep 
          their arms, it would be a great advantage to the island 
          who we fear have not at present arms enough in their 
          magazines to furnish them. Lastly, as we have been 
          informed that many of the soldiers in these regiments 
          have left their wives and families behind them, we 
          would humbly propose that some of your Majesty's 
          ships of war should be order'd to transport them to 
          Jamaica, either from <placeName ref="#gi" role="direct">Gibraltar</placeName> or elsewhere, by whose 
          means the propos'd settlement will be rendred 
          compleat, and this important island, which from its 
          critical situation in the midst of <placeName ref="#foreign_indies" role="indirect">foreign settlements</placeName> 
          is of the highest consequence to the trade and welfare 
          of <placeName ref="#gb" role="secondary">Great Britain</placeName>, will probably from being very thinly 
          peopled come in time to be well inhabited, which is a 
          point highly essential to the security of your Majesty's 
          Dominions in America, where the French and Spanish 
          settlements daily encrease, as well for preserving the 
          commerce of this Kingdom. [C.0. 138, 17. pp. 336-343.]</p>

        <p>Mr. Attorney and Mr. Solicitor General to the Council 
          of Trade and Plantations. Report upon the right to a tract 
          of <placeName ref="#us_me_sagadahock" role="direct">land between</placeName> the <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="boundary">Rivers Kennebeck</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#rv_stcroix" role="boundary">St. Croix</placeName> and the 
          petitions of Sir Bibye Lake and others and Samuel Waldo and 
          others etc. State case. Have heard Agents and Council on 
          behalf of the parties and H.M. Treasury. Report : 
          [Whereupon] it appears to us, that all the said tract of lands 
          is granted by the Charter to the inhabitants of 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the [Massachusetts Bay]</placeName>, and that thereby power is given to the 
          Governor and General Assembly to make grants of lands within 
          the said limits, subject to a provisoe that no such grants should 
          be of any force until H.M. etc. should have signified his approval 
          etc. It appears also by the said Charter that the rights of 
          Governmt. granted to the said Province extend over this tract 
          of land. It doth not appear to us that the inhabitants of the 
          said Province have been guilty of any such neglect or refusal 
          to defend this part of the country as can create a forfeiture of 
          that subordinate right of Government of the same, or of such 
          property in the soil as was granted to them by the said Charter ; 
          it being sworn by several of the affidavits that a fort was erected 
          there and for some time defended at the charge of the Province, 
          and that magistrates and Courts of Justice have been appointed 
          within this district, and that one of the Council of the Province 
          hath always been chosen for this division ; and tho' it is certain 
          that this part of the Province hath not been improved equally 
          with other parts thereof, yet considering the vast extent of 
          countrey granted by this Charter, and the great improvements 
          made in several parts of it, we conceive that will not create 
          a forfeiture, because in such cases it is not to be expected that 
          the whole should be cultivated and improved to the same 
          advantage, and whether there hath been such a neglect or 
          non-user of any part as may amount to a forfeiture must be 
          judged of, not upon the particular circumstances attending that 
          part only, but upon the circumstances of the whole. And if 
          the Province had incurred any forfeiture in the present case, 
          no advantage could be taken thereof but by a legal proceeding 
          by scire facias to repeal their Charter, or by inquisition finding 
          such forfeiture. As to the question stated in the case upon 
          the effect of the conquest of this tract of countrey by the French, 
          and the re-conquest thereof by General Nicholson, we conceive 
          that the said tract not having been yielded by the Crown of 
          England to France by any treaty, the conquest thereof by the 
          French created according to the law of Nations only a 
          suspension of the property of the former owners and not an 
          extinguishment of it, and that upon the re-conquest by General 
          Nicholson all the ancient rights both of the province and of 
          private persons, subjects of the Crown of Great Britain, did 
          revive and were restored jure post liminii. This rule holds the 
          more strongly in the present case in regard it appears by the 
          affidavits that the Province joined their forces to those which 
          came thither under General Nicholson in this service. For 
          these reasons we are of opinion that the said Charter still remains 
          in force, and that the Crown hath not power to appoint a 
          particular Governour over this part of the Province, or to 
          assign lands to persons desirous to settle there ; nor can the 
          Province grant these lands to private proprietors, without the 
          approbation of the Crown according to the Charter. As to the 
          case of the petitioners, who insist upon particular titles in 
          themselves to certain parcels of land lying within the district 
          in question, etc., we find by the deeds etc. produced by them, 
          that several of the petitioners and those under whom they claim 
          have had conveyances made to them of several of the said 
          parcels of land, some from the Council of Plimouth, which was 
          constituted by Charter in the reign of James the first and 
          whose grants are confirmed by the Charter of King William 
          and Queen Mary, and others from Indians pretending to be 
          owners thereof, under which grants large sums of money appear 
          by the affidavits to have been laid out in endeavouring to settle 
          and improve the lands therein comprized, several of which 
          sums were expended not many years agoe particularly a sum 
          of 20001. by Sir Bibye Lake in 1714, and other sums by others 
          of the petitioners in 1719 and 1720. And tho' these settlements 
          and improvements have been in great measure interrupted 
          and defeated by frequent wars and incursions of the Indians, 
          yet several of the petitioners or their tenants appear to 
          be still in possession of some parts of the said tract of 
          land. Some objections were made before as to the nature 
          of the grants and conveyances under which the petitioners 
          claimed, and to the manner of deducing down their titles ; 
          But we conceive that in questions of this kind concerning 
          rights to lands in the <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">West Indies</placeName>, and upon enquiries 
          of this nature, the same regularity and exactness is not 
          to be expected as in private suits concerning titles to 
          lands in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, but that in these cases the principal 
          regard ought to be had to the possession, and the expences the 
          partys have been at in endeavouring to settle and cultivate 
          such lands. Therefore upon the whole matter, we are of opinion 
          that the petitioners, their tenants or agents ought not to be 
          disturbed in their possession or interrupted in carrying on their 
          settlements in the lands granted to them within the district 
          in question. Signed, P. Yorke, C. Talbot. Endorsed, Recd.

          repulsed after many attempts to destroy it. This house,

          very good dwelling houses some of which were

          some remarks etc. which I doubt not will fully evince the greater 
          part of the depositions of his side to be entirely foreign to the

          Cosby to recommend to the Assembly the passing an act to 
          repeal so much of the Act of 1715 as restrains the power of the

          Governor Johnson to Mr. Popple. Sr. I have received 
          your favour of the 8th of April last and entertain the advice 
          you give me, as I am very well persuaded you mean it as my 
          friend and for my service, and shall in due time recommend to 
          the Assembly what their Lordships of Trade have commanded 
          me, in relation to the summons instead of a capias ; tho I 
          cannot give great hopes they will be prevailed on to alter the 
          law from the present practice of a capias to a summons ; which 
          is indeed (tho so called) no other than a capias, only with this 
          difference, that it brings the defendt. into Court tho not 
          personally served, but by leaving at his habitation, which 
          was attended by many abuses ; many people having had 
          judgments obtain'd against them, without knowing they ever 
          had been summoned ; and consequently in no capacity of 
          making their defence, for oportunitys were taken when people 
          were abroad (perhaps at the <placeName ref="#mt_cherokee" role="indirect">Charekie mountains</placeName>) 
          to thrust a summons under a person's door, and the Marshal swearing he 
          left the summons at the party's dwelling house, was sufficient 
          to proceed against the defendt. ex party ; and so judgmt. went 
          against him for what was charged in the writ, which was always 
          double the debt, and many times actions only of mallice to 
          prejudice anothers credit. The first process in the Courts <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="direct">here</placeName> 
          were from the first settlement until the year 1713, by a capias 
          only, as in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, when a law was made to proceed by a 
          summons, being limited to two years, it then returnd to the 
          old way of a capias, and so continued until 1720, when the 
          summons law was again revived, but the aforementioned inconveniencies 
          being found in it, it was again repealed in 1726 and 
          so continues. What their Lordps. mean by the first process 
          in England being supposed to be a summons is (I suppose) no 
          other than a demand of the debt ; but here the summons was 
          a copy of the capias or writ, which being left at the house of 
          the defendt. was to have the same effect as the writ personally 
          served ; which I am afraid the people here will never again 
          consent to. The Assembly of both Houses have now passd 
          a law for regulating the Jurys, in which was proposd to be a 
          clause obliging the plaintiff to try his suit against the defendt. 
          at the Precinct Court where the defendt. lived ; which was the 
          law and with great difficulty has been thrown out of the bill ; 
          and the action is now triable where the plaintif pleases ; which 
          has very much lessend the authority of the precinct Courts, 
          to the great satisfaction of the merchants, and trading people 
          here, and will be of great ease and advantage to the Marshall, 
          in the execution of his office, with which I hope they will be 
          satisfyed at present, and they may be assured I shall impartially 
          espouse their interest when it is founded on justice and publick 
          credit. The sessions is now almost at an end at the conclusion 
          of which I shall do myself the honour of acquainting their 
          Lordships with what has been transacted, which I hope will be 
          to their satisfaction. I shall on all occasions shew a due regard

          Minutes of Privy Council. The further report of the 
          Board of Trade, Aug. 11, concerning the two regiments at 
          <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> was read, and extracts of letters to Col. Cope from 
          the late Lt. Col. Townshend and Lt. Col. Cornwallis with a 
          message, inclosed, from the Assembly to the Council of Jamaica. 
          Their Lordships are humbly of opinion, that it may be for 
          H.M. service, that the two regiments be sent for home ; but 
          that in order to provide for the security of the island, Lt. Col. 
          Cornwallis, the Commanding Officer in either of the two 
          Regiments, be directed to review the two Independant 
          Companies there, and see that they be compleated by draughts, to 
          be made in proportion, out of both the Regiments that are to 
          come home, and as an encouragement to the soldiers that 
          shall be thus turned over, a bounty of 10£. a man be given them ; 
          That the Governor be directed, to induce the Assembly to give 
          all fitting encouragement for engageing the private men in 
          the said two Regiments to settle, with their families, in the 
          island, and that a proper discharge be given to such of them 
          as shall be willing to settle there ; But that the soldiers should 
          have their option, whether they will settle as inhabitants, or 
          go into the Independant Companies ; and that for the 
          Governor's direction, in the execution of these orders, copys 
          be sent him of ye several reports of the Board of Trade on this 
          head. 1 1/2 pp. [C.O. 5, 36. ff. 24, 24v.]</p>

          <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">Portsmouth, N.H.</placeName>, Aug. 16, 1731. 
          He did not intend to answer his letter of 2nd inst., as it was impossible 
          to do so, and keep within the bounds of the respect 
          he would pay to his Commission, but he then little 
          imagined what had come at the same time, though it 
          has been the town talk ever since. He was very angry 
          with the Gentleman who told him he had sent such 
          orders to Capt. Walton etc. (v. encl. ii, iii), because he 
          thought it an idle, ridiculous story, but upon being 
          told that there might be something in it, he hired a 
          boat and went to <placeName ref="#us_nh_newcastle" role="direct">the town of Newcastle</placeName> etc. Continues : 
          I went to a publick house, and sent for the Captain 
          of the <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">Fort</placeName> etc. Upon his telling me your Excellency's 
          orders, I desired to see them, which he refused, until 
          I said I had a right to see you, and should not regard 
          them until I did ; the Captain thereupon sent for 
          them, and left me, to go to the fort, the gate whereof 
          he shut, and put his garrison, consisting of two men, 
          under arms, I waited some time for his return and for 
          the man he had sent for your Excellency's letter, and 
          neither coming, I walked towards the fort, in the same 
          dress and posture I always walk in, with my sword 
          in my belt and my cane in my hand. I went alone 
          to the gate and knocked with my cane etc. The 
          Captain said I should not enter except I would go as 
          a private man etc. I insisted upon going in as Lieut- 
          Governour, and commanded him to read H.M. 
          Commission to me, which he positively refused, saying 
          he would obey H.E.'s orders etc. All this was in the 
          hearing of the [three] gentlemen [who had accompanied 
          him], and 40 or 50 fishermen, and others belonging to 
          the towne. The Captain then ordered your 
          Excellency's orders to be read aloud etc. I desired 
          an attested copy, which favour was granted etc. The 
          Captain then opened the gate and invited me to walk 
          in as a private gentleman etc. Although contrary 
          to H.M. Commission, such was his submission to H.E.'s 
          commands that he did not enter, " tho a thousand 
          men might drive sheep into the fort at any place but 
          the gate," and though he believes it was his duty to 
          have put the company of militia of the town of 
          Newcastle under arms and arrested the Captain for 
          rebellion, but his chief motive being to preserve peace, 
          he hopes a favourable construction will be placed at 
          home upon his not doing so. Continues : After this 
          I do not take it that I can stay here with safety, I am 
          sure I cannot with honour, for all your friends and 
          some in the Commission of the Peace say, that since 
          this order to Collo. Walton, my commission is superseded 
          or suspended, for, as by it, he is to receive no 
          orders from any but your Excellency, of consequence 
          others are not ; that fort etc. was always part of the 
          perquisites of my predecessors, and the Province 
          built an apartment in it where several of them have 
          lodged when they tho't fit, and tho' H.M. Commission 
          gives me all rights, privileges, profits, perquisites and 
          advantages to the same belonging, I never made any 
          pretention to this, purely to avoid disputes, but I 
          now acquaint your Excellency that I think it my 
          due, as well as 200£. per annum this currency of the 
          600£. salary setled by the Province, out of which my 
          predecessor always reced. so much from yours, as was 
          intended by the General Court, who setled it. I had 
          no tho't of ever mentioning this to you, but that this 
          most extraordinary step of yours puts me upon it. 
          And to convince you that no body is infallible, I send 
          you a copy of your dedimus etc., whereby you gave a 
          power to administer oaths which are abrogated by 
          Act of Parliament. Your Excellency has likewise 
          found fault with me for not administering oaths upon 
          Commissions which you yourself have allowed to be 
          so deficient as to make out new ones, etc. Will make 
          no complaint <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">home</placeName>, if he is given reasonable 
          satisfaction etc. Signed, David Dunbar. Copy. 3 pp.</p>

          observe you have' (with Collo. Sherburne) administered 
          the oaths to Capt. Wybird, which is well, and that 
          the Lt. Governor had made a pretence to suspend the 
          Secretary, which I now write him is out of his power, 
          and I order the Secretary to go on chearfully in his 
          office, notwithstanding that insignificant paper he 
          signed, as I do you again to abide by the commission 
          I gave you for Fort Mary, and not to suffer the least 
          insult on your commission from any person whatsoever, 
          nor to let any one come into the fort but those that 
          come in a curteous civil manner, I mean that the 
          Lieutenant Governor nor any others should come by 
          way of command or in derogation to the orders I have 
          given you etc. The Lieut. Governour writes me he 
          shall order you to attend continually at the fort. I 
          would have you always remember you are to receive 
          no orders but from me, and mine are to do in your 
          command of the fort as the late Lieut. Governour did,

          (v. 11th July) and copies by way of <placeName ref="#ie_cork" role="secondary">Cork</placeName> 
          and some new ones to his brother to be laid before the Board. 
          Continues : I take that method because ye sight of 
          so many at once might frighten you. Repeats part of preceding 
          covering letter and encloses copies of Nos. i, ii preceding. 
          Continues : I am very apprehensive I shall be blamed for 
          submitting to the orders etc. I shall be impatient to have an 
          answer to this etc. Requests him to assist his brother in putting 
          these papers into a method to be laid before the Board. Among 
          them is the case and dispute between the Governor and Theodore 
          Atkinson who has acted two years as Collector. The Commission 
          of the Peace has not yet been amended. Six townships 
          are still without Magistrates. Encloses a dedimus from the 
          Governor to administer oaths wch. are contrary to law and his 
          Instructions. " All these mistakes are (I believe) chiefly oweing 
          to a little pert Attorney here, who is now Secretary of the 
          Province, a Judge and Justice of the Peace, and H.E.'s chief 
          Counsellour, it is to this gentleman that the divisions and 
          confusions in <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">this small province</placeName> are owing " etc. Repeats 
          complaint against Act, due to his persuasion and pique to this 
          town, for removing the Courts from <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">Portsmouth</placeName> to three

          the County town, which is within 7 miles of

          forced to promise to emit mony, I mean bills of credit here, 
          to get their consent to pass that act, and he then told them he 
          could not signe the mony bills without orders." There are 
          daily complaints about the boundary lines. He hopes- H.M. 
          will explain the Charter etc. Continues : " Here is a report 
          that Mr. Secretary Waldron and his emissarys are getting a 
          number of names to a petition in some private manner by way 
          of contradiction to the representation I was desired to send 
          to you, and that was very publique, and 500 names could have 
          been got, but I sayd there was no occasion. It is a melancholly

          Maryland. <placeName ref="#us_md_annapolis" role="from">Annapolis</placeName>, 19th Aug. 1731. Reply to queries 
          as to the trade and produce of the Province transmitted by 
          the Council of Trade and Plantations. Continue : For want 
          of an opportunity to examine the books of the Officers of the 
          Customs, we cannot be so particular as we wish to be etc. 
          Continue: There are very few trading vessels belonging to 
          the inhabitants, several of the twelve counties having not one 
          etc. We could not learn any more than one small vessel has 
          gone from this province (belonging to the inhabitants thereof) 
          to any of the foreign <placeName ref="#foreign_indies" role="indirect">Sugar Plantations</placeName>; a few vessels have 
          gone to <placeName ref="#madeira" role="indirect">Madera</placeName>, and others of the Portuguese islands, one, two 
          or three in a year, and for several years none. This Province 
          has very little trade with any part of <placeName ref="#europe" role="indirect">Europe</placeName> beside 
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>, and that confin'd to a few voyages by three or four 
          small vessels in several years past to <placeName ref="#pt_lisbon" role="indirect">Lisbon</placeName>, which carried 
          grain and lumber thither. All the commodities ever exported 
          to, or imported from any of the foreign Plantations, belonging 
          to the French and Dutch, by the inhabitants of this Province, 
          that we could learn, has only been the lading of the small vessels 
          already mention'd, which carried lumber and provisions, and 
          brought back mellosses ; save that sometimes when vessels 
          have been disappointed of their lading in H.M. Colonies, they 
          have taken in some salt in the said foreign Plantations. The 
          trade to Madera and other Portuguese islands has been more 
          considerable : sometimes one small vessel and sometimes two 
          or three, but never more that we could learn (belonging to this 
          province) have gone thither in a year ; which vessels have 
          carried wheat, Indian corn and other provisions, and staves, 
          and brought back Madera and other wines of the produce of 
          those islands and salt. As to vessels belonging to other parts of 
          H.M. Dominions, whose ladings are purchased in this province, 
          we cannot give any account of them. The climate here is 
          moderate, the soil productive of all sorts of grain, and many 
          sorts of fruit, and has great quantities of valuable timber ; and 
          in many places good pasturage ; and the rivers and <placeName ref="#by_chesapeake" role="indirect">bay</placeName> full 
          of great variety of fish, especially herrings : But the inhabitants, 
          ever since the first settlement of this country, have applied 
          themselves principally to the making tobaco, which is our only 
          staple, neglecting manufactures and tillage, when tobaco has 
          been valuable ; the produce of that commodity alone being 
          then sufficient to supply the people with cloathing, and other 
          necessaries, in great plenty, from Great Britain, with an overplus 
          in mony, which has always been lodged there ; not only as the 
          securest, but the most advantageous repository, whence the 
          people cou'd be supplied with every thing for their own use or 
          for traffick ; hence it has happen'd that the people have receiv'd 
          very little advantage from a moderate climate, and a fertile 
          and fruitful soil, besides provisions, and the produce of their 
          tobaco, which for several years past has been really so very low 
          that it would not supply the inhabitants with one half of the 
          necessaries of life ; and the expectation of an amendment has 
          occasion'd their continuing in the old beaten tract so long, 
          that they are now reduc'd to an incapacity to carry on any 
          considerable trade or manufactures. It is true, that extreme 
          want and necessity have driven some of the poorer sort of people 
          in several parts to make some small quantities of coarse linens 
          and woollens for their own particular use, without which they 
          must have gone naked and been starved ; of these manufactures 
          we are confident there are none exported ; and that very few 
          (if any) make enough of them to supply their own necessities ; 
          As to the value of other commodities of the growth and 
          production of the country, annually exported besides tobaco, 
          we cannot make any estimate. Those concern'd in the 
          exportation, and who reap the advantages arising from it, being 
          such as come from other parts to purchase what the people 
          can spare, which their necessities oblige them to part with at 
          very cheap rates. Thus, may it please your Excellency, we have 
          given a full state of the circumstances of the country concerning

        <p><placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="from">Portsmouth</placeName>. 
          Lt. Governor Dunbar to Mr. Popple. Has received 
          reply from Governor Belcher (v. Aug. 18), justifying his order 
          for shutting him out of <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">the Fort</placeName> etc. Continues : This order 
          of the 18th of July is grounded upon falsitys reported to him 
          by a poor old creature formerly one of this country Collonels, 
          and now made Capt. of the Fort, to whom I solemnly declare 
          that I sayd no more than, that the command of the Fort, and 
          any little perquisits attending it, allways belonged to the 
          Leiut. Governours, and I had a right by my Comn. to 
          everything enjoyd. by them, he replyed he had H.E.'s 
          Commissn. to be Capt of it, and hoped, as he was very antient I 
          would not deprive him of the small perquisits he had by it, my 
          answer was, that if it was my right as Lieut. Governour I would 
          either have it, or he should own the obligation to me, that it 
          was not worth disputeing, and that if I could not have it without 
          a comission from Governour Belcher, I would not have it at 
          all, for I would take no commission from him etc. Mr. Walton 
          has, it seems, made something more of it etc. You see his 
          Excellency thanks him for a list of the restless and uneasy, I 
          wish my Lords would ask Coll. Shute, Mr. Walton's character, 
          it is such that nobody here would hang a cat upon his evidence, 
          and for this reason some former Govrs., particularly Shute had 
          his name put far back in the list of the Council, yt. he might 
          have no chance of ever commanding <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">the Province</placeName>; Many 
          people from <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName> and the late Governour Dummer have 
          sent me their opinion, which also aggrees with the gentlemen 
          of best note here, that by the last clause in the chief Governour's 
          Commission, he has no power but when he is actually present 
          in the Province ; agt. that paragraph he has left the 36th 
          article of his instructions upon the Secretary's files etc. Fears 
          he will be blamed for giving in to him, but could not avoid it 
          without violence. As he has occasion in other places, will go 
          hence till he receives further orders. If Mr. Belcher is judged 
          in the right, begs to be excused serving under him. " I am not 
          the onely man by a great many he uses ill ; he never darst 
          offer the least affront to man until now that he lords it over all, 
          for he has formerly been chastized by cane, whip and foot, 
          without resenting it, wch. makes it the more griveous to be ill 
          used by such a man etc., by his carriage and style he seems to 
          think himself King. He does not permit the Lieut. Governour 
          of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">ye Massachusetts</placeName>, tho' one of his own recommendation, to 
          sitt in Council with him, so that he is quite a stranger to 
          all the busyness of the Province etc. I suppose when he comes 
          here, he will tell me I have no busyness in Council whilst he sitts 
          there, but I will not submit to that etc. I have for some time 
          expected a Comn. for a new Judge of Vice-Admiralty at 
          Boston. I am sure there is a necessity for it etc. I have some 
          time since seized a parcel of masts in <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="direct">Piscatua river</placeName> at 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">this towne</placeName>, and intended to try them here but as they were cutt 
          on the other side of the river in the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">province of Maine</placeName>, they 
          must be tryed in the Massachusets Govt., upon which I sent 
          to the Advocate Genll, for an opinion and to get a deputation 
          for George Jeffrey Esq. who has long acted and is now Deputy 
          Judge of Vice-Admiralty, to hold a Court on the other side 
          this river etc. Mr. Belcher upon hearing this has prevaild upon 
          the old Judge of Admiralty at Boston, to give a deputation to 
          one Gambling etc. ; this is done on purpose to oppose H.M. 
          interest, Mr. Gambling haveing allways as an Attorny appeared 
          on the other side, and now there will be new cases, and Doctor 
          Cook, Govr. Belcher's chief favourite, will be the first, who haveing in open defyance 
          to authority cutt mast trees far up in <placeName ref="#rv_saco" role="direct">Saco River</placeName> 
          near <placeName ref="#us_me_portland" role="indirect">Casco</placeName>, I have seized them in boards, as I 
          have done several quantitys in this province etc. I will try 
          what a Court will judge in this case, but now think I have 
          very little chance. Encloses the Governor's orders to me 
          relateing to a Collector, and least I should not give lett passes 
          as he directs, he has sent some blank passes signed by himself, 
          and as he has given orders to the Captain of the Fort to receive 
          no orders from me, I intend they make use of their own papers. 
          I have already mentioned a clandestine petition etc., and I am 
          desired to send vou extracts of former letters to the Province 
          Agents, signed by the promoters of this petition as a Comittee 
          appointed by the Genll. Court for yt. purpose, to shew you that 
          it is no new chimera, as is now alledged. I am very sensible 
          I must be thought too troublesome to my Lords Commissioners 
          etc. If my Lords will be pleased to part Mr. Belcher and me 
          it will save much of it. I send you one of the clearances of his 
          new Collector, and an impression of a seal which will make any 
          vessel lyable to a seizure, as all Custome Houses in H.M. 
          Dominions know each others seal, this I have told the new 
          Collector, and that he is not quallifyed by law to act as you'l 
          see in your pacqt. by the oaths wch. have been administerd to 
          him, but we live under a Governour that will salve all mistakes

        <p>377. iv. Governor Belcher to Capt. Walton. <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="from">Boston</placeName>, July 
          18, 1731. I have yours before me of 16 currant and 
          am apt to think the strange appearances you mention 
          will soon vanish into smoke, and the people will come 
          to themselves, and believe who have designs to hurt 
          and ruin them, and who are their friends. I thank 
          you for a list of the restless and uneasy. If some 
          people might enjoy all the places of profit and honour 
          in the Province, as they have for many years past, 
          they wou'd be well content. But I think it time and 
          very reasonable some other families shou'd share in 
          the advantages of the Government. I particularly 
          observe these words in your letter " As for <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">the fort</placeName>
          your Excellency has been pleased to favour me with 
          the Leiut. Govr. says he shall never accept your 
          Commission for it, for that he says he looks upon with 
          contempt, but swears nobody shall command there 
          but a commission from himself." Since the Leiut. 
          Govr. does not know his duty or is not willing to 
          practice it my order is that you abide by the 
          Commission, I have given you, and not suffer him, nor 
          any other person to come into the fort, or have 
          anything to do with it, but by such orders, as you receive 
          from me from time to time. As to the complaint sent 
          <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">home</placeName> against me in the ship that sail'd from 
          <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="direct">your river</placeName> the 15th currt., I shall laugh at all they can 
          say, if they don't lye. The common complaint has 
          been that <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> is not able to support a 
          Government in the present circumstances, how can 
          they then pretend to be an independant Government. 
          For 30 odd years that Province has been under the 
          same Governor with <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts</placeName>, how comes 
          it then, all on a sudden to be necessary to have a new regulation ?

          16th Aug., 1731. The post being here (who came 
          away the day after your Honour's of 12th present) 
          and bringing me no further account of the Indians 
          you mention, I hope they were got together on no other

          believe I have some time since notifyed you of my 
          appointing Richard Wibird Esq., Collector of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, since which I wrote the late Deputy 
          Collector that I had sent a dedimus for administering 
          the oaths to Capt. Wibird, and expected his conforming 
          thereto, and in answer he wrote me, he wou'd neither 
          deliver the seal of office, nor the instructions he had, 
          and since that refused to do it on a special warrant 
          I sent him, and has also presum'd to give clearances 
          as a Collector, and the present Collector writes me, 
          as well as the Capt. of <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">Fort William and Mary</placeName>, that 
          you have given passes for vessels cleared by him, and 
          to some of them that have not cleared at the Naval 
          Office. I hope those who have been advisers in the 
          matter, especially to the poor men who have violated 
          the Acts of Trade in not clearing at the Naval Office, 
          will make good to them the damage and difficulties 
          they may have run themselves into. As to the late 
          Deputy Collector, he's not worth my further notice 
          at present. But to prevent all breaches of the Acts 
          of Trade for the future, and loss of the subjects' 
          estate, or any interruption to the trade, I once more 
          tell your Honour, that I have appointed Richard 
          Wibird etc. It is my order that you be at all times 
          aiding and assisting him, and sign no pass for any 
          vessel to the Capt. of the Fort without mentioning 
          therein, the said vessel's being duly cleared by Richard

          your letter this morning about 11 o'clock I can't 
          really say whether 4 1/2 minutes before or after, tho' 
          these niceties are great things with you, or you would 
          not think my mistaking the name of <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">the Fort</placeName> worth 
          mentioning, and to convince you that infallibility is 
          not your talent, I send you a copy of Capt. Husk's 
          commission only to show you what you writ under it, 
          and to know whether any man living can tell the 
          day or year you administred the oaths to him, but 
          these are trifles I think not worth your notice or 
          mine, and notwithstanding the mistake Mr. Secry. 
          Waldron might make in writing the dedimus, I doubt 
          not but the proper oaths have been duly administred 
          etc. I am freely willing you should send <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">home</placeName> copies 
          of my letters, depending you'll be so just as to send 
          copies of yours to me etc. Sends copy of his letter to 
          Capt. Walton, 18 July (No. iv supra). The Commissions 
          I give are the King's Commissions and it is 
          your duty to treat them with great respect etc. The 
          late Lt. Govr. kept command of the fort by my 
          proclamation, and no otherwise, nor do I find anything 
          in your commission, or any act of the Government 
          that settles the command of that fort upon the Leiut. 
          Govr. etc. Would have given it to him, if he had asked 
          for it and not treated his commission with contempt. 
          Continues : The passes you give to the fort are 
          properly mine and so I believe you'll find the licences 
          for marriage etc. My only answer to what you say, 
          about sharing my salary, is that it made me smile. 
          Your predecessor never had the face to say a word 
          to me on that head, nor did I practice any mean 
          condescentions with the Assembly to get it done, 
          but told 'em frankly and freely before they did it, 
          no one shou'd ever have a farthing of it, and I have 
          long since recd. an approbation from home, of the 
          handsome manner in which I got the salary settled 
          etc. It was a fault in you not to administer the oaths 
          when the gentn. waited on you by my order. The 
          commissions were not deficient, but good and full, 
          so far as I had extended 'em. If I pleas'd to enlarge 
          'em afterwards, that was more than you knew in the 
          time of it etc. You are too assuming in your letters. 
          Nor do I want your dictating to whom I shall read 
          your letters or my own etc. Continues : I am under 
          no concern about your complaint home, because I 
          insist upon it, that I am always present at <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> 
          when <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">here</placeName>, or that government wou'd be

          Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Abstract. Col. Dunbar is a gentleman of such 
          an uncommon temper that he expects to have to be constantly 
          defending himself against his unjust insinuations. Refers to 
          letter of 12th July. Col. Dunbar's thirst of power and honour 
          beyond his rank cannot be acceded to by any Governor. When 
          the Capt. of <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">Fort William and Mary</placeName> reported that the Lieut. 
          Governor said he would never accept his commission for it, he 
          thought it high time to assert the King's honour against insults 
          and behaviour which could only lead to anarchy. The Governor 
          has never been esteemed absent from <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> when at 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts</placeName>. Refers to 36th instruction. It cannot be 
          imagined that the King only made him Governor for about six 
          weeks in the year the time he spends with the Assembly there. 
          Repeats former arguments. It being but 66 miles from <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="indirect">Boston</placeName>, 
          and the post passing every week, regrets that he has to trouble 
          the Board with the enclosed letters, but he expects Col. Dunbar 
          will dress up an extraordinary relation of this affair. He will 
          esteem it a great favour to be delivered from this uneasy gentleman etc.

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. I am 
          now to confirm what I wrote your Grace 26 of last month, 
          respecting the supply of the Treasury. The Assembly have 
          now been sitting upwards 12 weeks, and seem resolved to 
          provide no money for the defence of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Government</placeName>, and the 
          protection of the inhabitants, unless I wou'd sign a bill for it 
          in open violation of H.M. commands, and upon a motion the 
          House of Representatives made to me for a recess, I immediately 
          ordered all the members of H.M. Council, to attend their duty 
          in the General Court, and then demanded of them, upon the 
          oath they had taken, answers to the questions your Grace will 
          find in my message to the House of Representatives of 28 July 
          (as by their Journals inclos'd). Upon this they summon'd 
          their absent members to attend, and when they came together, 
          the result was, to make a declaration, and send it to every 
          town in the Province, in order to call the inhabitants of each 
          town together, to have their orders or instructions about the 
          supply of the Treasury, and I have no reason to believe but 
          their answer will be just as the Representatives wou'd have it, 
          vizt. That the Treasury shou'd not be supply'd in conformity 
          to the King's Instruction. Upon the whole, my Lord Duke, 
          I think it my duty seasonably to represent to you the great 
          difficulty and hazard this matter must necessarily (and very 
          soon) bring upon H.M. Government here, and all his good 
          subjects. For your Grace must be sensible, it's impossible for 
          a Government to subsist long without money. For my own 
          part, I am fully in opinion that H.M. Instruction to me in this 
          matter is exactly agreeable to the Royal Charter, as well as to 
          the best safety and happiness of this Government and people. 
          Yet as I have no reason to believe the House of Representatives 
          will comply with it, it is absolutely necessary for the preservation 
          of H.M. Government and people here, that your Grace transmit 
          me as soon as possible the King's special order upon this head. 
          For altho' the Assembly have been sitting now near 13 weeks, 
          yet I believe they will go on to sit, till I have an answer from 
          your Grace, and their so doing will be a vast burden to the 
          Province, and no service, for they have done nothing of any 
          significancy for several weeks past. P.S. I had almost forgot 
          to acquaint your Grace that notwithstanding the royal 
          explanatory Charter says that " it shall be lawful for the 
          Representatives etc. to adjourn themselves from day to day 
          (and if occasion shall require for the space of two days) but 
          not for any longer time without leave from the Governor etc," 
          yet the Representatives did on Saturday 10th July adjourn 
          themselves to Tuesday, 13th. On which day I sent a message 
          to them on that subject, which they so little regarded as to 
          repeat such an adjournment the 24th of July. Their pretence 
          for this is the intervention of the Lord's Day, which I think 
          can by no means support such an unwarrantable practice. 
          For I believe the maxim of dies dominicus non est dies jucundus, 
          was the reason of that saving for 'em in the explanatory charter 
          (and if occasion shall require for the space of two days) that 
          they might not be oblig'd to sit on the Lord's Day. I hope 
          your Grace will let me know H.M. pleasure on this head. Signed, 
          J. Belcher. 2 3/4 pp. [C.O. 5, 898. No. 94.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. An 
          act was pass'd in your Majesty's Colony in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> in Oct., 
          1705, against importing tobacco from <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName> and other parts 
          without the <placeName ref="#cape_henry" role="indirect">Capes of Virginia</placeName>; and in 1726, another act was 
          pass'd for the more effectual preventing the bringing tobacco from 
          <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="direct">North Carolina</placeName> and the bounds in controversy ; We have lately 
          received a memorial on the part of the inhabitants of <placeName ref="#us_nc_albemarle" role="direct">Albemarle County</placeName>
          in North Carolina, setting forth the great hardships they 
          labour under, from being denyed the liberty of exporting their 
          tobacco to <placeName ref="#gb" role="secondary">Great Britain</placeName> from the ports in Virginia. 
          Whereupon we beg leave to represent to your Majesty that the only 
          commodious port in North Carolina is at <placeName ref="#us_nc_capefear" role="direct">Cape Fear</placeName>, scituated 
          near the southern boundary of that county, so that if those 
          planters who are settled to the northward near the borders of 
          Virginia, are cut off from all communication with that Province 
          both by land and water, as these acts import, they will lye 
          under very great difficulties in exporting their tobacco to Great 
          Britain, therefore will probably desist from planting that 
          commodity, and turn their industry to other manufactures, 
          which may be attended with very bad consequences to the 
          trade of this Kingdom, from whence the inhabitants of North 
          Carolina have hitherto taken considerable quantities of British 
          manufactures, which they have been enabled to pay for by their 
          tobacco. These laws are therefore manifestly disadvantagious
          to the trade of this Kingdom, and it would seem to us, highly 
          unreasonable, that any of your Majesty's subjects should be 
          debar'd from the liberty of making use of any ports belonging 
          to your Majesty, or from carrying on any legal trade not prohibited 
          by the laws of Great Britain in any part of your Majesty's 
          Dominions ; We likewise conceive that these laws are 
          inconsistent with an Act of Parliament, 25th of K. Charles II, for 
          the encouragement of the <placeName ref="#gl" role="secondary">Greenland</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#baltic_sea" role="secondary">Eastland</placeName> trades etc. By this last act, the productions 
          of the <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">British Colonies in America</placeName> are allowed to be 
          exported from one English Province to another, under certain duties etc. 
          For these reasons we humbly beg leave to lay these laws
          before your Majesty for your disallowance. [C.O. 5, 1366. pp. 76-78.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Committee of the Privy Council. 
          In obedience to orders of 7th July, have heard the merchants of <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName>, 
          <placeName ref="#en_bristol" role="indirect">Bristol</placeName> and <placeName ref="#en_liverpool" role="indirect">Liverpool</placeName>
          in support of their petition against the Act of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> for raising 
          several sums of money etc., and likewise Mr. Sharp in defence 
          of it. This act lays a duty of 15s. on negroes imported and 
          30s. on negroes exported, and 100£. on convicts imported etc. 
          This act so far as it relates to duties on negroes is a burthen 
          upon the British trade and navigation and contrary to Governor 
          Hunter's additional Instruction, 13th Nov.. 1727 etc. Altho' 
          H.M. was graciously pleased by his said instruction to allow that 
          the Assembly might lay such a tax on the negroes of the said 
          island bought there as they should think fit, yet this indulgence 
          was never designed to be extended to the present case, where 
          duties of import are laid upon all slaves imported, whether the 
          property be changed or not, during their stay in the island, 
          and a duty of export also laid without any exception for such 
          slaves as should be imported only for refreshment, which must 
          necessarily affect all slaves brought thither on account of the 
          Assiento contract, etc. The duty upon convicts is a strong 
          infringement of the Act of Parliament etc. for the further preventing 
          robbery etc., and for the more effectual transportation of 
          felons, which extends to all H.M. Plantations in general ; but 
          by this exorbitant duty is now become impracticable with 
          relation to Jamaica. For these reasons therefore we should 
          propose to your Lordps., that this act might be laid before 
          H.M. for his disallowance. But forasmuch as the same is only 
          a temporary law ; that it will expire in Feb. next, that it would 
          be some time before H.M. disallowance could reach Jamaica, 
          and that the duties raised by this law are in part applicable 
          to the additional subsistence of the two regiments now in that 
          island ; considering also that we have lately proposed to H.M. 
          that the soldiers of the said two regiments after filling up the 
          independant companies their to their full complement may be 
          disbanded and left in Jamaica for the defence of that island 
          provided the Assembly will settle them to their entire satisfaction, 
          which must be a considerable expence to the Colony, 
          we would submit to your Lordps. in the present situation 
          whether it may not be adviseable to suffer this act even bad 
          as it is to have its effect. But at the same time, lest the 
          Assembly should be thereby encouraged to make any attempts 
          of the like nature on the Trade and Navigation of Great Britain 
          for the future, we would humbly propose that your Lordps. 
          should advise H.M. to signify his dissatisfaction of this 
          proceeding to Major General Hunter, and to command him upon 
          pain of his royal displeasure to adhere more strictly to his 
          instruction for the future. And since the Assembly of Jamaica 
          have made so bad an use of H.M. indulgence to them in his 
          abovementioned Instruction, we would further propose that 
          the Governor should be absolutely forbid for the future to give 
          his assent to any law imposing duties upon slaves imported 
          payable by the importer and upon slaves exported, that have 
          not been sold in the island and continued there for the space of 
          twelve months : But ye merchants are willing and we have 
          no objection to their laying duties upon the purchase of slaves 
          in Jamaica, to be paid by the purchaser, and not by the importer, 
          provided the South Sea Company and their Factors be exempted 
          from paying any duties for such slaves as shall be consigned to 
          them, or which they may purchase there from the traders to 
          the coast of <placeName ref="#africa" role="secondary">Africa</placeName> in order to fulfill the Assiento contract. 
          And should your Lordps. concur with us in opinion with respect 
          to the future regulation of these duties, we would take leave to 
          propose that the same might be made a general rule for 
          <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="indirect">all the Plantations</placeName>, and that Instructions 
          may be prepared accordingly for H.M. Govrs. of

          A law is now subjoined confirming and establishing this

          to recommendation of my Lords Commissioners signified to 
          the Councill and Assembly, I think, by the late Governor Hart, 
          and the assurances that were given them that the collection

        <p>Representation of the General Assembly of <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">Barbados</placeName> 
          to the Council of Trade and Plantations. The said Island 
          has for many years past been a very profitable colony to 
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">G. Britain</placeName>, as well by its produce and import of sugar, rum, 
          molosses, cotton, ginger and aloes, as by its taking off from 
          thence great quantities of woollen and other manufactures and 
          goods that pay duties to the Crown, (which by means of ye 
          Barbados trade, are part consumed among the inhabitants of 
          the said island, and other part thereof are exported from Great Britain to 
          <placeName ref="#africa" role="indirect">Africa</placeName> and <placeName ref="#madeira" role="indirect">Madera</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">the Northern British Colonies</placeName>, for the purchase of negroes, 
          wine, fish and other goods for the use of this Island, and thereby numberless hands have been 
          employ'd in H.M. Kingdoms and Territories, and great revenues 
          have accrued to the Crown) and has also been a great support 
          to H.M. Northern Colonies, and given a very great and profitable 
          vent to their fishery and other produce as also to the produce 
          of <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName>: Besides employing in those several trades great 
          numbers of shipping and seamen etc., and after all has used 
          to leave a considerable ballance in England to the benefit of 
          the national stock. The intrest of this Island and all other 
          <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="indirect">H.M. Sugar Colonies</placeName> is closely united with that of Great Britain, 
          and all those Sugar Colonies must ever be dependent on it, and 
          be supply'd from thence, because they have no trade or 
          manufactures which can interfere with those of Great Britain. 
          Within these few years great improvements have been made by 
          the French and Dutch in their Sugar Colonies, and great and 
          extraordinary encouragements have been given to them, not 
          only from their Mother-countrys, but also from a pernicious 
          trade carried on to and from Ireland and the British Northern 
          Colonies, and have to spare for <placeName ref="#nl" role="indirect">Holland</placeName>, 
          <placeName ref="#de" role="indirect">Germany</placeName>, <placeName ref="#it" role="indirect">Italy</placeName> 
          and other parts of <placeName ref="#europe" role="indirect">Europe</placeName>, and the French and Dutch Sugar Colonies 
          have lately supply'd the Northern British Colonies with very 
          large quantities of melosses, for the making of rum and other 
          uses ; and even with rum of their own manufacture, to the 
          vast prejudice of H.M. Sugar Colonies, as rum is a commodity 
          on which next to sugar they mostly depend, and have had in 
          return for such sugar, rum and molosses, shipping, horses, 
          boards, staves, hoops, lumber, timber for building, fish, bread, 
          bacon, corn, flower and other Plantation necessaries, at as easy 
          rates as H.M. subjects of the Sugar Colonies have. And the 
          continual supplies received by the French and Dutch from the 
          Northern British Colonies, have enabled them to put on and 
          maintain a great number of slaves on their plantations, and 
          to enlarge their sugar works and make new settlements in new 
          fertile soils, and at the same time cost little, being now purchased 
          chiefly with molosses, which before the late intercourse between 
          <placeName ref="#foreign_indies" role="indirect">the foreign Colonies</placeName> and the Northern British Colonies, were 
          flung away, as of no value. And thus the French and Dutch 
          Colonies are daily improving, while H.M. Sugar Colonies are 
          apparently declining, and instead of supplying, as they used to 
          do, <placeName ref="#fr" role="indirect">France</placeName> and Holland, and many other parts of Europe with 
          sugar, are now almost confined to the home consumption in 
          Great Britain, and are in a great measure excluded from the 
          Kingdom of Ireland, and the Northern British Colonies, who, 
          instead of sending their produce as usual, to H.M. Sugar Colonies, 
          and taking rum and sugar in return, do now often send it directly 
          to the foreign Sugar Colonies in exchange for the produce of 
          those foreign colonies : and whenever they do send their produce 
          to the British Sugar Colonies, they insist upon being paid for 
          it in cash, which they export to, and lay out among the foreign 
          Sugar Colonies, in the purchase of the very same goods that 
          they formerly used to supply themselves with from H.M. Sugar 
          Colonies, to the enriching the foreign Sugar Colonies, and 
          impoverishing His Majesty's. The mischiefs arising to H.M. 
          Sugar Colonies from this commerce (which is apparently in 
          derogation and evasion of the 5th and 6th Articles of the Treaty 
          of Peace in America etc., 1686), are very many and evident, 
          and will increase more and more, if some effectual stop be not 
          put to it. <placeName ref="#mq" role="indirect">Martinico</placeName> is now arrived to a very great pitch of prosperity and power, 
          and affords new supplies of people for settling the neighbouring islands of <placeName ref="#dm" role="indirect">Dominico</placeName>, 
          <placeName ref="#stvincent" role="indirect">St. Vincents</placeName> and <placeName ref="#lc" role="indirect">Sta. Lucia</placeName>;
          and <placeName ref="#gp" role="indirect">Guardaloupe</placeName>, <placeName ref="#gp_grandterre" role="indirect">Grand-Terre</placeName>, 
          <placeName ref="#gp_marygalante" role="indirect">Marygalante</placeName>, <placeName ref="#gd" role="indirect">Granada</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#gf" role="indirect">Cayene</placeName> encrease and flourish in proportion : and 
          on <placeName ref="#is_hispaniola" role="indirect">Hispaniola</placeName>, the French spread so fast as to become formidable 
          to their neighbours, whilst many of the planters in the British 
          Sugar Colonies and particularly in this Island, have been and 
          daily are necessitated to forsake their ancient well built estates 
          and shelter themselves in <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="indirect">Pennsylvania</placeName>,
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="indirect">New York</placeName> and other Northern British Colonies. 
          This apparent increase of the riches and power of the French Sugar Colonies 
          is in great measure owing to the commerce aforesaid, which is destructive to the 
          British Sugar Colonies, but highly advantageous to the French, 
          who thereby find a vent not only for their sugar, but also for 
          their rum and molosses etc., and have those supplies of lumber, 
          horses and plantation stores, without which they never could 
          have enlarged or supported, nor can support their sugar planta- 
          tions etc. Other causes contribute to make H.M. Sugar Colonies 
          decline and the French Sugar Colonies flourish. The French 
          Sugar Colonies receive the greatest encouragement from their 
          Mother Country, and their duties are less than ours. The 
          French King is daily sending men to his Sugar Colonies, and 
          pays their passage thither, and maintains them there a year 
          after their arrival. He encourages their trade to <placeName ref="#gw" role="indirect">Guinea</placeName> by 
          giving a proemium for every negro imported thither from Africa. 
          He remits one half of the duty upon such goods of the produce 
          of his Sugar Colonies as are brought home in return for such 
          negroes. He maintains the fortifications in his Sugar Colonies. 
          He permits Spanish ships to trade with them, and particularly 
          for pieces of 8/8 in exchange for flower and other goods, wch. 
          they get from the British Northern Colonies in return for their 
          sugar, rum and molosses. He permits them to trade to the 
          Spanish Islands of <placeName ref="#is_margarita" role="indirect">Margaritta</placeName>,
          <placeName ref="#trinidad" role="indirect">Trinidado</placeName> and <placeName ref="#pr" role="indirect">Porto Rico</placeName>,
          and he allows them to send directly to the ports of <placeName ref="#es" role="indirect">Spain</placeName> sugars 
          of all sorts (except raw or muscovado sugars) and also all other 
          goods of the product of the French Islds. in America, paying a 
          duty of one pr. cent, only on exportation, without first importing 
          them into France. Whilst on the other hand H.M. Sugar 
          Colonies have no such encouragements. The inhabitants of 
          this and all other H.M. Sugar Colonies are obliged to carry their 
          sugars and all other enumerated goods first into Great Britain, 
          after paying in the Colonies where they are produced (<placeName ref="#jm" role="indirect">Jamaica</placeName> 
          excepted) a duty of 4 1/2 p.c. in specie on exportation, before they 
          can carry them anywhere else (except to the other British 
          Colonies) and are obliged upon exporting them afterwards from 
          Great Britain, to leave in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> a duty of near 2 p.c., and 
          are put to the risque of a double voyage, besides the charge 
          of it, which amounts to not less than 20 p.c. more. H.M. 
          subjects of this and other his Sugar Colonies pay upwards of 
          10 p.c. more than the French and Dutch do, for what sugar is 
          carried to H.M. Northern Colonies and consumed there, by 
          which means those Colonies are mostly supply'd with foreign 
          sugar, to the prejudice of the Plantation duties (being part of 
          the aggragate fund, which might otherwise be greatly increased) 
          and altho' the French and Dutch subjects of the Sugar Colonies 
          do so send their sugar as well as their rum and molosses to the 
          Northern British Colonies, yet the subjects of H.M. Sugar 
          Colonies are restrained from vending their produce to the French 
          or Dutch Colonies, and at the same time H.M. subjects of the 
          Northern British Colonies and Ireland have that advantage. 
          And the French are at liberty to send their sugars directly to 
          Ireland, without first importing them into Great Britain, and 
          paying a duty there to H.M., which H.M. subjects of the Sugar 
          Colonies are obliged to do, and they are supply'd with beef 
          and other provisions directly from Ireland on as easy terms as 
          H.M. subjects are. Those and many other advantages the 
          foreign Sugar Colonies, and especially the French have over 
          H.M. Sugar Colonies, and particularly this Island, whom it has 
          pleased the Almighty God in his good Providence to afflict 
          lately in a more especial manner by a most violent tempest 
          and hurricane, which began on the 13th day of this instant 
          August, and lasted all that and the succeeding day, with the 
          utmost fury, to the inexpressible terror and immense damage of 
          the inhabitants, who have had not only a great many of their 
          corn-fields, plaintain-walks, fruit and timber trees blown down, 
          broken or torn up by the roots, and their canes damaged, but 
          their dwelling-houses, windmills, boyling-houses and other their 
          best and most substantial buildings, some of them wholly 
          demolished, and others overset, rent, uncover'd or otherwise 
          greatly damnify'd ; and so general has the calamity been, that 
          there is scarce a person throughout the whole Island but who 
          has received a considerable loss by this dreadful storm, the 
          consequences of which are still more grievous, for that there is 
          not in this Island (nor has been here for some years since that 
          pernicious trade between the Northern British Colonies and the 
          foreign Sugar Colonies began) lumber sufficient to repair a tenth 
          part of the buildings damaged by this tempest. This scarcity of 
          lumber is one of the many mischievous effects of that trade, and 
          great is the number of our poor inhabitants, who now have no 
          place to lay their heads in, and ly exposed to all the injuries 
          of the approaching rainy season for want of those northern 
          supplies which our neighbours the French are plentifully 
          furnished with. So great is our present desolation that many 
          of the poorer inhabitants, unable to rebuild their ruined houses, 
          will be driven to quit the Island ; and thus our strength decays, 
          and at the same time the exorbitant power of the French at our 
          very doors, threatens us with instant destruction in case of a 
          war. For their isles are full of men and arms, whilst the inhabi- 
          tants of this Island grow every day thinner, and want allmost 
          everything necessary for their defence. But should a war not 
          happen, yet the British Sugar Colonies will still be in danger 
          of being lost to the British Nation, unless some speedy care be 
          taken to save them from the ruin now impending over them ; 
          and if they are lost, Great Britain will lose the export of all the 
          British manufactures now taken off by the Sugar Colonies, and 
          the whole benefit arising from the importation of their product. 
          Our Navigation and seamen must necessarily fall off and 
          diminish, the African trade as chiefly depending on the Sugar 
          Colonies must decay : and our sugar-works and other plantation 
          stock and utensils become of no use, and thereby so much 
          wealth will be sunk and lost to the British Nation. And in 
          that case too, such of the Northern British Colonies as now 
          court a French trade and French dependance, will soon be 
          reduced to a condition too wretched to be named, and an end 
          be put to the British Empire in America ; But may God avert 
          those evils ! Nor are we without hopes that the British Sugar 
          Colonies may still be preserved, and even restored to their 
          former flourishing condition, if timely measures be yet taken 
          for removing the many and great disadvantages they now ly 
          under in point of trade ; and proper encouragement be given 
          them. Whether a prohibition of the importation of all sugar, 
          rum and melosses of the growth, product or manufacture of 
          any of the Plantations in America, which are not in the 
          possession of or under the dominion of His Majesty, into the

          Colonies and the foreign Sugar Colonies, or of any particular 
          branches of trade, as namely those of horses and lumber, or the 
          granting H.M. subjects of the Sugar Colonies the like advantages 
          in their trade, as the subjects of the foreign Sugar Colonies now 
          actually have, whether all or any of these, or what other 
          measures in particular may be proper and sufficient to attain 
          the good ends desired etc., we presume not to say ; but humbly 
          hope that your Lordships will be pleased to take the premises 
          into consideration and thereupon do what to your Lordships

        <p>Sir W. Keith to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Haveing observed with great attention what was said at the 
          Board on last Wedensday to the Switz petitioners etc. (v. 10th 
          Aug., 1st Sept.), and being myself fully convinced of the many 
          and great advantages which would most certainly accrue to 
          the public interest of this Kingdom by <placeName ref="#rv_hawksbill" role="direct">such a settlement</placeName>, I 
          should be very sory if so noble a design was altogether laid 
          aside etc. Continues : If H.M. could be moved to appoint 
          a fit person with proper authorities to grant those lands to such 
          as should actually come to setle there, under the same conditions 
          which were proposed by the Board to the Switz petitioners, 
          I am perswaded the encouragement could be sufficient to invite 
          forreigners as well as others thankfully to accept of it etc. As 
          the person so appointed must be invested with the necessary 
          powers of governing and directing the first settlement of so 
          important a Colony, he ought to be a man of experience in 
          military as well as civil affairs, possessed of a character in all 
          respects equal to the trust and likeways upon the spot to execute 
          it with effect. Collo. Spotswood whose present situation in 
          <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> is in a maner contiguous to the proposed settlement 
          seems to be of all others the fittest person etc. His integrity 
          and great abilities are well known to your Lordships etc. Your 
          Lordships will do me the justice to believe, it is my regard for 
          the public service, and not any privat view to myself which 
          has induced me to lay these maters before you etc. Signed,

          Address of Members of Council, Judges, Justices and 
          other officers and inhabitants of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> to the King. 
          Refer to former address expressing gratitude for continuing a 
          Governor so acceptable to the people. Continue : Notwithstanding 
          which, some restless persons for about three weeks 
          past, have been endeavouring to disquiet the minds of the 
          weaker sort amongst us in order to memorial " the Governour 
          to the Lords of Trade etc. as a person not a friend to the Province, 
          and to pray that New Hamps. may be no longer under the 
          Governour of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts Bay</placeName>; wch. essay gives birth 
          to the present Address etc. For in duty to our Sovereign, in 
          honour to our Governour, in faithfullness to the Province, and 
          in justice to our-selves we cannot be dumb on such an occasion, 
          but most humbly crave leave to bear testimony against an 
          attempt (tho' never so unlikely to succeed), wch. tends to sap 
          the very foundation of our happiness etc. Your Majesty's 
          Councill can witness the Governour's solicitous concern for 
          the settlement of the divisional line between the two Provinces, 
          and his unwearied endeavours to accomplish it with the strictest 
          impartiallity ; which is what we earnestly supplicate may have 
          as speedy an issue as is consistant with your Majesty's royal 
          pleasure ; for the longer the difference lyes open, the greater 
          are the mischiefs wch. attend it. But to return to His 
          Excellency, What is it that we can't all say, (without a 
          compliment) even the little number of discontented, themselves, 
          in praise of our Governour whose administration is so wise, 
          so just, so equal, and to such universall acceptance, and who 
          will without any question make such unbiased remonstrances 
          to your Majesty upon this unfortunate misunderstanding as 
          may be a means at last to bring it to a happy issue. May it 
          please your Majesty, this your Majesty's Province is so small, 
          the people so few and in general so poor that it makes the 
          settlement of the lines still more necessary, and is no bad 
          argument to enforce our humble request for being continued 
          under the Governour of the Massachusetts Bay, and especially 
          him who at present is, and we hope will long continue in that 
          station. For we have done our utmost already, even to our 
          almost undoing, in fixing so large a sum for the Governour's 
          sallary, pursuant to your Majesty's Instruction, and if more 
          should be required to support the dignity of a resident 
          Governour, we can forsee nothing but inevitable ruin : and 
          besides if we should again be visited with a French or Indian 
          war, or both (as at this juncture we are threatened,) then yet 
          more deplorable would our condition be, for now we can ask 
          succours (as occasion may require) from the common Father 
          of both Provences, with hopes of success ; but how it may be 
          upon a different footing God alone knows. Numberless 
          arguments we humbly concieve might be used to induce yr. 
          Majesty's favour in continuing us under our present Governour, 
          but your Majesty's consummate wisdom, as well as goodness 
          makes them unnecessary, and as we know what has been offered 
          (by any who are the troublers of our Israel) in a way of 
          impeachment of H.E. conduct, can't fail of redounding to his honour 
          (even without a reply) so we shall attempt no particular answer, 
          but leave that to himself if he shall think it worth his while. 
          Pray for H.M. long and glorious reign etc., " and when the 
          period of mortal life expires, that your Majesty may be 
          translated to the mansions of bliss, and there reign with the King 
          Eternal for ever and ever. With humble obeysance we now 
          withdraw from vour Majesty's presence " etc. 72 signatures.

          Governor Belcher <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">[[ed. of Massachusetts]]</placeName> to the 
          Council of Trade and Plantations. Abstract. He wishes he was rid of 
          Lt. Govr. Dunbar <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">[[ed. of New Hampshire]]</placeName>, who, 
          he hears, is representing that he has debarred 
          him of all the perquisites of a Lt. Governor, which he supposes 
          arises from his orders relating to passes for vessels to pass the 
          fort. It is doubtless the Lt. Governor's duty to give them in 
          the manner he directs, but suspecting that he would not do so, 
          he sent passes of his own, that the trade might not suffer. 
          Thereupon, the Lt. Gov. sent (27th Aug.) a paper to the 
          Collector, copy enclosed. Till he refused signing the passes 
          in conformity with these orders, he always gave them and 
          received the perquisites of them. The great difference between 
          them is whether he shall control the Governor, or be subject 
          to him. He will suffer no insult from Col. Dunbar. For 30 
          years it has been ruled from <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">home</placeName>, that the Governor of both 
          Provinces was always present in each when in either, and the 
          Lieut. Govr. did everything by the Governor's orders ; and the 
          late Lt. Govr. Vaughan was dismist in Govr. Shute's time for 
          presuming to do otherwise. If the present Lt. Govr. will behave 
          with proper respect and good manners, and ask him, as a favour, 
          for what his predecessor enjoyed, he shall have it. He hopes 
          the Board will never countenance the thirst he has to subvert 
          all good order and government. Signed, J. Belcher. Endorsed,

        <p>Mr. Ochs and Mr. Stauber to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Return thanks for favourable reception of and 
          offer their final proposals, as suggested by the Board. As to 
          the Board's view that the <placeName ref="#rv_hawksbill" role="direct">intended Colony</placeName> should not be charged 
          with the maintenance of a Governour, submit that the success 
          of the Colony will be chiefly in the conduct of the managers, 
          who will be at great expence in collecting settlers from <placeName ref="#de" role="indirect">Germany</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#ch" role="indirect">Switzerland</placeName>, providing passages and cattle for them, 
          planting white mulberry trees for silk-worms, mills and tools 
          etc. Mr. Stauber has already spent 200£. and two years' time, 
          and will require at least 100£. more to engage and conduct the 
          people for the first time etc. As their Lordships do not incline 
          to grant a certain district of land as was desired etc. the managers 
          therefore humbly desire to be granted the privilege to dispose 
          of all the land that shall be taken up within 10 years from 
          their first arrival at 10£. sterl. pr. 100 acres, more or less according 
          to the quality of the land etc., which sum will be saved to the 
          people in the first year in the passage buying of cattle etc., and 
          that the two managers may be granted a certain quantity of 
          land free for ever from quit-rents etc. " But it is to be hoped 
          that Mr. Bury's proposal is not to be instanced to this Colony 
          for the different situation and labour, and if their Lordships 
          knew his circumstances and conduct they would take no notice 
          thereof." If the Board find it necessary, though nobody would 
          be willing in the interest of the Colony to appoint one of the 
          Managers as Governor, without some appointment, yet one of 
          the Managers, though he would rather be without the trouble, 
          will submit to their proposals and terms etc. The fixing of the 
          quit-rent etc. is submitted to their Lordships' discretion etc. 
          Naturalisation is desired for all Protestants that settle there 
          in general, or for a small charge to have a naturalization granted 
          by the Governor. It is desired that the laws of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">this Kingdom</placeName> 
          may be administered in German etc., and to have liberty to make 
          laws and ordinances with the approbation of the Government, 
          like other Colonies. If their Lordships would ordain that all 
          Protestants without distinction of opinion might equally enjoy 
          all priviledges and rights alike, it would much add to the increase 
          of the Colony, which had so great an effect in <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="indirect">Pensilvania</placeName>, that 
          the people resorted thither in much greater numbers. This 
          Colony being an inland country, the inhabitants are obliged to 
          pass through other colonies, as <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName>, 
          <placeName ref="#us_md" role="indirect">Maryland</placeName> and Pensilvania etc. It is desired that these Provinces 
          may not have power to lay any duty or custom upon their goods passing 
          through their Colonys, nor for the selling of their horses, cattle 
          or production in the sayd Colonys. As the language of this 
          people is German, desire that they should always have in future 
          a Governour appointed to them of the best qualify'd person 
          among them, of which the Assembly to nominate 2, 3 or more 
          persons and the Government to chuse which would be most 
          acceptable thereof etc. As this Colony is to be a new Province 
          under the Government of the Crown, it is humbly presumed 
          that the Commission, Patent and required instruments will be 
          delivered without charge, which their Lordships are desired 
          to procure with as much expedition as possible. Endorsed,

          notwithstanding H.M. commands to other Governments, not to

          memorial presented to the General Assembly ; after 
          their reading of which, and hearing our Councils 
          arguments thereon, they made the said act, and have 
          emitted the money without the assent of the Governr., 
          who hath now address'd himself to our gracious 
          Sovereign Lord the King in a letter enclos'd with our 
          papers to Mr. Sandford, etc. After we had taken out

          immediately summon'd in the General Assembly ;

          took away all our attested copies before mention' d,

          emitting 60,000£. etc., entred in these words, his 
          Honr. ye Govr. dissents from ye said vote, Do declare 
          the same to be no part of sd. act of Assembly and 
          that said act be noways encumbred thereby, but that 
          the said dissent be deemed null and void for the 
          following reasons : (i) For that the said act was 
          made and past at the sessions began on 14th June 
          1731, and continued till 24th June and no longer as 
          may appear by the records etc. and that during said
          time the Genl. Assembly were not apprised or knowing 
          of any dissent but caused said act to be published and 
          the same has taken effect and proceedings have been 
          made thereon accordingly, (ii) For that it appears 
          said dissent was given in to the Secry. and entred on 
          the 25th June, which was one day after the rising of 
          sd. Genl. Assembly, which is conceived inconsistant 
          with all rule and methods of proceeding it not being 
          in the power of the Legislative authority to act except 
          when duly conveen'd much less for any single member 
          to incumber any act by dissenting or protesting after 
          the rising of the Court, (iii) For that it is not clear 
          what vote sd. dissent referred to there being many 
          votes preceeding the same, (iv) For that the aforesaid 
          post entry of sd. dissent depriv'd the Genl. Assembly 
          of the benefit of considering the consequence thereof.

          Governor Burrington to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Abstract. Refers to letter of 1st July. In spite of opposition in the House of Burgesses, 
          spirited up by some of the Council, he has kept <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="direct">the country</placeName>
          in perfect peace, and entirely stopped the riots which used to be so frequent. 
          The rioters were headed by Edmond Porter, Judge of the Admiralty, 
          a man of so infamous a character that it would be for H.M. 
          service if he were removed from the Council. Mr. Smith, late 
          Chief Justice, has secretly left for <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, promising to obtain 
          the removal of the Governor etc. He has left with the character 
          of a silly rash boy, a busy fool and egregious sot. He is, besides, 
          an ungratefull perfidious scoundrel, and as much wanting in 
          truth as in understanding etc. Owing to his absence and that 
          of other Councillors, he has had difficulty about holding a General 
          Court and Court of Admiralty, besides a dispute with Mr. Smith 
          about the Governor's power to fill vacancies in the Council. 
          Recommends Mr. Lovick for the Council, against whom neither 
          Sir Richard Everard nor Porter had the least evidence to support 
          their complaints. " We expect our Indians will be attackt 
          by those of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="direct">S. Carolina</placeName> etc. The Five Nations are in alliance 
          with ours, and have promised to assist them with 1000 men, 
          part of which are already come into this Province." Has sworn 
          Mr. Lovick as a Councillor, and also Edmond Gale, and 
          appointed John Palin Chief Justice. Believes Mr. Porter will 
          trouble the Board with his reasons against his appointing 
          Councillors, of which he encloses a copy and answers. Porter 
          is a man of infamous character etc. A new Assembly is to meet 
          in November, but no good can be done until H.M. pleasure is 
          known upon the pretended laws of 1729, after H.M. purchase 
          was completed, and as to quit-rents etc., and officers' fees being 
          paid in proclamation or bills as rated by the Assembly. Proposes 
          to prorogue the Assembly until instructed on these points. 
          Refers to former remarks on Act relating to escheated lands. 
          Has refused to grant patents for such lands, as he finds that 
          law not consistent with his 43rd Instruction. Gives further 
          reasons against the Act for biennial Assemblies, and proposes 
          to alter the present distribution of seats, settled by that act, 
          which also allows all freemen to vote for burgesses, contrary 
          to his 12th Instruction that none but freeholders be admitted 
          to vote, which has occasioned a great deal of heat among the 
          people. Hopes the Act will be repealed. Awaits the arrival 
          of an Auditor before sending public accounts, very little money 
          having as yet been received or paid, and there being no Auditor, 
          Receiver General or public Treasurer. A multiplicity of business 
          and a dangerous sickness have hitherto prevented him from 
          surveying the harbours in accordance with his 100th Instruction. 
          It will be a work of some difficulty and expence. The 
          inhabitants declare very much against fortifications, but as 
          there are three harbours capable of receiving large ships, some 
          must be erected. Will report thereon before Christmas. Gives 
          an account of the value and currency of the bills of credit. A 
          pistole is not to be purchased under eight pounds in bills. 
          English goods sell from 15 to 20 in bills above their cost price 
          in England, but if the bills are allowed by H.M. to be current, 
          believes they will soon come to the value they are rated, which 
          is four for one in Proclamation money. Mr. Moseley was much 
          concerned with Sir R. Everard in taking up lands. When the 
          enquiry into the complaints against Sir Richard were begun 
          in Council Mr. Smith, Mr. Porter and Mr. Ashe succeeded in 
          stopping it. Has had information of malpractices by Mr. 
          Moseley and his deputies in returning to the Secretary's office 
          imaginary surveys, by which his relations hold great quantities 
          of land more than are specified in their patents. Explains his 
          own purchase of some lands which he is assured will be the 
          subject of complaint against him. He heard that Indians took 
          up ore on those lands of which they made bullets. He gave 
          more for them than they are judged to be worth. They are 100 
          miles above the falls of <placeName ref="#rv_capefear" role="direct">Cape Fear River</placeName> The greater part he 
          bought of Moseley, the great land jobber of this country, who 
          has still 20,000 acres to sell when he can find purchasers. Gives 
          a state of the Councill and proposes persons for vacancies. 
          Some of the owners of lands gained by the new boundary with 
          <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> refuse to take out patents for them, on which he desires 
          instructions. Will send an account of the Militia, and of 
          improvements that may be made in the county, which entirely 
          depends upon the quit-rents that are to be paid for lands to be 
          taken up, and opening a port on <placeName ref="#is_ocracoke" role="direct">Ocacock Island</placeName> etc. Many 
          people have come into the country to settle lately ; more are 
          coming from neighbouring colonies, notwithstanding there is 
          but one entry for taking up land, neither has the person who 
          made the entry gone on with the survey by reason of the quit- 
          rent etc. " When I undertook the settlement of the Southern 
          part of this Province (with consent of the Proprietors' Council) 
          warrants were given to people that were disposed to settle there, 
          by which inducement a great many people did then seat lands 
          in that uninhabited country and have not since had patents. 
          I think it will be hard upon these people to be removed, many 
          of them would be ruined. I pray your Lordships' directions 
          in this tender affair. Printed, N.C. Col. Rec. iii, 202. Signed, G. Burrington.

          never be able to affect it, people accustomed to live

          is a very happy country where people may live with

          in my time. It is true the soil is good etc., but transporting

        <p><placeName ref="#us_va" role="from">Virginia</placeName>. 
          Lt. Governor Gooch to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Having seen the bill which passed the House of 
          Commons the last sessions, a bill for the better secureing and 
          encourageing the trade of H.M. Sugar Plantations, and the vote 
          wherein it was resolved to address H.M., that the Lords of 
          Trade etc., I did presume to think, notwithstanding the great 
          variety of pamphlets published on the subject, something might         
          be said from the Southern part of the Continent that would be 
          acceptable to your Lordships etc. The main scope of this bill, 
          as appears by the preamble, is to prohibit all trade from H.M. 
          Plantations on <placeName ref="#n_america" role="direct">the Continent of America</placeName> to any of the 
          <placeName ref="#foreign_indies" role="direct">foreign Sugar Islands</placeName>, and this in order to promote 
          the welfare and prosperity of <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="direct">H.M. own Sugar Islands</placeName>.
          If this could be accomplished without notable prejudice to the other 
          Plantations at least equally valuable, and of as much consequence and 
          importance to the Navigation, strength and wealth of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> 
          no man would envy the Sugar Colonies any benefits which the 
          indulgence of their Sovereign, or the benevolence of a British 
          Parliament should think proper to conferr : But if the 
          prohibition desired shal appear manifestly injurious to the 
          Provinces on the Continent, who may humbly hope for an equal 
          share of the affections of their Mother Country, it may be 
          expected that all measures will be discouraged which tend to 
          raise the grandeur of one part of H.M. Plantations upon the 
          ruin of the other. The commoditys with which the Plantations 
          on the Continent supply the Sugar Islands are flower, bisket, 
          beef, pork, fish, staves, heading and all kinds of lumber : in 
          return of which the Continent receive chiefly, sugar melasses 
          and rum. And it must be observed that as the Sugar Colonys 
          could not subsist without such supplies from the Continent, so 
          are they generally so great plenty, that they often spare of these 
          provisions to the French and Dutch, the merchants of <placeName ref="#bb" role="indirect">Barbados</placeName>
          and the <placeName ref="#leeward" role="indirect">Leeward Islands</placeName> being the first that taught the people 
          of the Continent to find out a market in the foreign Islands for 
          those superfluous commoditys our own could not consume, 
          In like manner when the crops in our Sugar Plantations have 
          happened to miscarry, as they frequently do through great 
          droughts or hurricanes, the same merchants thought it no way 
          inconsistent with the interest of their own sugar colonys to 
          purchase from their foreign neighbours the commoditys 
          necessary for the people on the Continent, and even to furnish 
          the British markets with the same. The plenty of all kind of 
          provisions with which the Plantations on the Continent abound 
          being more than sufficient to supply the Sugar Islands, it seems, 
          not a little hard, to prohibit them from seeking a market where 
          they can find one : But it will appear very impolitic to cramp 
          their industry by the prohibition proposed, for the following 
          reasons : First, most of the Northern Colonys have scarce any 
          other way of making remittances to Great Britain than by the 
          provision and lumber they export to the <placeName ref="#indies" role="direct">West Indies</placeName>, and the 
          sugar they ship there for <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> to purchase such necessaries 
          as they want from thence : and whether these returns be made 
          in sugars of the product of H.M. islands or of those of foreigners, 
          Great Brittain is still the mart for both, and the returns the 
          Continent receive are in British manufactures. But if they 
          can find no other vent for their provisions and lumber than 
          what H.M. Sugar Islands afford, the remittances for Britain, 
          and their consumption of British manufactures must be 
          proportionable diminished, and the people forced by necessity 
          to apply themselves to manufactures of their own to make up 
          that deficiency. Secondly, as the French sugars and melasses 
          are purchased commonly at half the price the like commoditys 
          bear in the British Islands, it is with the former that the 
          Northern parts of the Continent are chiefly supplied for their 
          own consumption : and it needs no art to demonstrate that by 
          this means the exports of the French Plantations to the 
          <placeName ref="#europe" role="indirect">European markets</placeName> are much lessened, and that of the British 
          Sugar Colonys not decreased, since all their produce which is 
          not taken off by the Plantations must be carried to the British 
          markets. Thirdly, this prohibition may often prove of ill 
          consequence to the trade of Great Britain, as well as a detriment 
          to the Plantations on the Continent : for since it frequently 
          happens that the crops in the British Sugar Islands fail, as it 
          is probable they will this year in particular, by the unseasonableness 
          of the weather, it would not only be highly injurious 
          to the Continent to deny them the liberty of supplying yourselves 
          elsewhere, but it will also deprive them of the means of furnishing 
          the British markets with foreign sugars, thereby still making 
          Britain the general staple for the sugar trade, which otherwise 
          upon any such accident must be transfer'd to another Nation. 
          Fourthly, as the prohibition seems chiefly calculated to give 
          the Sugar Islands an advantage over the rest of H.M. 
          Plantations, in obliging the people on the Continent to sell 
          their commoditys and take sugar melosses and rum at what 
          price the West Indians think fit ; it may not be amiss to consider 
          the great disadvantages the inhabitants on the Continent 
          already ly under with respect to their trade to the Sugar 
          Islands, as thus. Very often their provisions yield little more 
          than the first cost : that the charge for cask for rum and 
          melasses, the commissions for storage and factorage, with the 
          expence of the masters of the vessels trading thither, who have 
          an extraordinary allowance over and above their pay, eats 
          out the greatest part of the profits of the most prosperous 
          voyages. Another very great advantage the Sugar Colonys 
          have in trade is, that all the necessaries they want are brought 
          to their doors without any risque to them, whilst the people 
          on the Continent are forced to run the hazard outward and 
          homeward, and that a great part of the commoditys purchased 
          in the Sugar Islands for the Continent is with Bills of Exchange 
          payable in Great Britain. Whereas on the other hand no 
          instance can be given of any such payments for commoditys 
          carried to the West India market. One would imagine that 
          these advantages in trade, together with the benefit of their 
          situation, which saves them the expence of cloathing their 
          slaves, and is so great a charge to the Provinces on the Continent, 
          might well serve to content these Gentlemen, without asking 
          further advantages over their fellow-subjects. However, let 
          us now turn our thoughts to the effect this prohibition in all 
          likelihood will produce. And it frequently happens that the 
          pit the mischievous man digs, he fals into himself. Now tho' 
          it must be confessed that the Provinces on the Continent 
          through long usage can ill bear a total privation of rum, one of 
          the principal commoditys with which they are furnished from 
          the Sugar Islands, yet it is very evident they can easily provide 
          themselves with spirits of equal goodness, whenever the people 
          shal think fit to apply their industry that way. The more 
          Northern Colonys are already so well improved in husbandry 
          that they make malt liquor little inferiour to any in England : 
          and if the people of <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#us_md" role="direct">Maryland</placeName> should be forced by necessity, 
          or disposed by choice to sett apart some of their best land, which they now solely employ 
          in the production of tobacco, for sowing of barley, it is certain they might be as 
          well supplied with malt liquor as any country in H.M. Dominions ; 
          and so also might the Province of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="direct">Carolina</placeName>, where 
          there is much good land proper for that grain ; so that there is 
          no family in either of these Provinces, but what may furnish 
          themselves with much cheaper and more wholesome liquor, 
          than any they can be provided with from the West Indies ; 
          and if their servants or slaves require the more spirituous 
          liquor, there will be found little difference Malt spirits which 
          may be made in plenty, and the rum of the West Indies now so 
          highly prized, unless it be in the cleanliness of the materials of 
          the first, compared with the nastiness of the last. Add to this 
          the great quantitys of cider with which all the Colonys on the 
          Continent abound, and they afford a sufficient fund to supply 
          themselves with that kind of brandy, which, if well distilled, 
          doth far exceed any rum the Sugar Islands have yet produced. 
          Then as to the melasses, which in <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> and the other 
          Northern Colonys is only employed for distillation, and in the 
          Southern Colonys on the Continent for brewing beer, there 
          would be no manner of need of it for either of these uses, and 
          thus the disadvantages the prohibition would bring the people of 
          the Continent under, will very quickly fall upon the contrivers 
          of it. They might then keep their rum and melasses to them- 
          selves, and be forced to send for their provisions and lumber 
          at their own risque, and pay such price as those who will furnish 
          them think fit to impose. Whereas, would they be content to 
          enjoy the trade as it is now carried on, the people on the 
          Continent would still be willing to take off their commoditys 
          as they have hitherto done, tho' under very apparent inequality 
          in all the branches of the trade between them. As to sugar it 
          must be acknowledged that the Plantations on the Continent 
          can hardly subsist without it, but then the people are not 
          ignorant that it may be had as cheap from England as from 
          the place of its manufacture, allowing for the Plantation duty 
          paid upon the exportation of sugar from the West Indies to 
          other Colonys, and the drawback upon its exportation from 
          Great Britain. But admitting that the British Sugar Islands 
          and the Continent should mutually engage to carry on the 
          projected trade, and should be able to subsist without foreign 
          help, how are the gentlemen of our Islands sure that this 
          prohibition will diminish the trade of the foreign Colonys : 
          Have not the French new settlements going on both at the 
          <placeName ref="#us_la_neworleans" role="indirect">mouth of the Messisippi</placeName>, and at 
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="indirect">Cape Breton</placeName> sufficient to furnish 
          their sugar settlements with lumber for cask, and with the 
          ordinary application of that Nation may be able in a few years 
          to furnish them with bread and other provisions ; and if they 
          want vessels for transportation, they may be supplied by the 
          present owners of ships in New England, <placeName ref="#us_ri" role="indirect">Rhode Island</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#bm" role="indirect">Bermudas</placeName> now the common carryers between the West Indies 
          and the Continent, who would then have nothing else to do but 
          to sell their vessels, unless they charitably delivered them up 
          to their discarded mariners to seek their fortunes in the way 
          of piracy, since 'tis morally impossible that such a number of 
          stout fellows as are now employed in that trade, can content 
          ymselves to starve on shore. The Dutch indeed they have 
          no settlements on the Continent to support their sugar 
          plantations, but 'tis not to be imagined that they will desert 
          them, if the West Indian gentlemen should prevail in their 
          pursuit : for since it is well known the Dutch can afford without 
          one stick of timber of their own growth to build ships much 
          cheaper than their neighbours, it will be no great difficulty for 
          them to find cash for their own sugar, without being beholden 
          to the British Plantations ; nor will they be under much greater 
          difficulty to transport thither provisions, such as their settle- 
          ments stand in need of, from Europe, when it is considered how 
          many ships of force and great burthen they send annually to 
          trade on the <placeName ref="#spanishcoast" role="indirect">Spanish coast</placeName>, which, 
          besides their ordinary cargos, can stow each a large quantity both of 
          staves and provisions, and deliver the same at <placeName ref="#gr" role="indirect">Surinam</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#curacao" role="indirect">Curasso</placeName>, where they 
          generally touch without any considerable interruption to their 
          principal voyage. Hence I think it appears that neither French 
          nor Dutch will be much embarrassed by the prohibition of 
          provisions or lumber ; and as for horses, it will be found, upon 
          a more strict scrutiny, that the number and value of them is so 
          very small, that it was not worth while to mention them for 
          any other reason than to shew that an horse is a creature which 
          may be employed to turn a sugar mill on occasion, as well as to 
          carry an officer out of the way of his duty, whilst an interloper 
          is loading goods prohibited by the ordinances of the port, as 
          most of the horse of any value carryed to the foreign islands 
          are designed. Seeing therefore that this prohibition can have 
          no other influence upon the foreign Sugar Islands, than to 
          quicken their diligence in improving their settlements so as to 
          want no supplies from us ; that it plainly tends to the increasing 
          of the foreign Navigation, and at the same time lessens that of 
          H.M. subjects ; that whatever specious pretences may have 
          been used to induce the Honourable House of Commons to the 
          passing of the bill, yet that the true design is to entail lasting 
          disadvantages on H.M. subjects on the Continent, by obliging 
          them to sell their commoditys to the West Indies at what price 
          those people are pleased to give, and to receive payment at an 
          advance on the goods they have in return, it will be no new 
          thing if the inhabitants on the Continent get from under the 
          load as soon as they can etc. To conclude, it is evident that 
          for so much foreign sugars as shal be taken off by H.M. subjects 
          on the Continent, whether the same be expended amongst 
          themselves or carried to Great Britain, so much less of that 
          commodity will be exported from these foreign colonys to 
          Europe, where it is the interest of England to keep the markets 
          under its own power ; and since it cannot be denied but that 
          if Great Britain could engross all the sugar made in America, 
          it would be of great advantage to the general trade of the Nation, 
          I humbly offer to your Lordships' consideration, whether in the 
          stead of this prohibiting bill, another might not be brought in, 
          whereby all H.M. subjects may be permitted to carry to the 
          foreign settlements all such commoditys as are not forbid by 
          law to be exported thither ; that, continuing still the same 
          restriction against the importation of goods of the growth, 
          production or manufacture of Europe, all such enumerated 
          commoditys as shall be laden at those foreign Plantations, 
          shal be brought from thence directly to Great Britain, or some 
          of H.M. Plantations under the severest penaltys ; and that 
          if any of the said commoditys are to be again exported, the 
          same shal be under the like bonds and restrictions as the 
          commoditys of the growth of H.M. Plantations now are. Such 
          an act would employ a great number of people on the Continent. 
          It will enlarge the importation of sugars into Great Britain, 
          and lessen that of our rival neighbours, besides many other 
          advantages etc. Signed, William Gooch. Endorsed, Recd. 10th Nov.,

          Lt. Governor Dunbar to Mr. Popple. Encloses receipt

          orders from <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> and of seeing Governor Belcher, " tho' 
          the people at the new settlemts. are at a stand and idle for want 
          of me, and great numbers there waiting for me that have no 
          beginning to work upon " etc. Will now sail at once. Encloses 
          one of Govr. Belcher's lett passes, the fee whereof is but one 
          shilling sterl., as he fancies it would hardly be credited that he 
          would send such from another province, " the filling up is with 
          the hand of H.E.'s Naval Officer, pray observe it." Continues : 
          The new Collector therein named [Richard Wibird] had 
          a seizure made in his own warehouse of tobacco illegally 
          imported <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">here</placeName>, the Depty. Collr. from home made the seizure, 
          and of the vessel that imported it. After him the new Collector 
          seized and marked his own tobacco and vessel, and some other 
          vessels haveing been seized here by order of Governour Belcher 
          for omitting some little ceremonys with his new officers, the 
          Judge of Vice Admiralty with the Advocate General, and other 
          Officers of ye Court came hither from <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="indirect">Boston</placeName>, and held Courts 
          on the 9th and 10th inst. Each of said Collectors exhibited 
          their libels, the old Collector against the vessel and tobacco, 
          but the Judge, who is Mr. Belcher's brother by marriage,  
          dismissed it and decreed costs of Court against him, the new 
          Collector dropt his seizure of his own vessel, and disowned 
          ye tobacco, wch. was thereupon condemned. I was all the 
          time in Court and was provoked to see such partiallity and 
          thereupon desird the trial might be adjourned to yesterday 
          morning with intent to get ye names of ye wittnesses from the 
          old Collector, which he readily gave me, but they were secretted 
          away, and when I complained in ye Court of the injustice done 
          to H.M. thereby, the Judge in open Court told me I came in 
          there as an informer, and harrangued the Court with telling 
          them with a high voice that as Surveyor of the Woods I putt 
          the poor people in terrors by seizures of their trees and logs, 
          all I could say to him availed nothing. I have often complained 
          of him to no purpose, besides his very great age (now 79 years) 
          he has allways been an unmannerly brutish man, notwith- 
          standing which I should have committed him for his insult 
          and treatment of me but in respect to my Lds. of the Admiralty 
          whose officer he is ; By the 46th Instruction to Govr. Shute 
          and 56th to the late Govr. Barnet, they were directed not to 
          admit any officer to act until they had quallifyed themselves 
          by takeing the oaths required by law, upon which, and not 
          knowing Mr. Belcher's Instruction upon that head, I produced 
          the two original beforementiond Instructions in Court and 
          thereupon delivered to the Court a paper etc., copy enclosed. 
          The Judge read it and was outragious calling it an odd, turbulent 
          paper. I desired the Advocate's opinion of it, wch. he refused, 
          but another lawyer told me ye qualification therein mentioned 
          was absolutely necessary in <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">this Province</placeName>. Notwithstanding 
          all this, he made decrees and went away wth. his officers to 
          Boston, boasting how he had used me ; a Leiut. Governour 
          under my present circumstances, as to power is a needless 
          officer lyable to affronts without remedy here, one instance at 
          this time of it is an order lately sent by the Govr. to a Capt. 
          of a troop of militia to meet H.E. with his troops on the lines 
          between the two Provinces next week without takeing any 
          notice of me. I am sensible I am under some obligations of 
          corresponding with the Comrs. of the Customes, but as I do 
          not know in what manner for want of Instructions, I beg 
          to be excused to them. I send you a copy of a comn. to a 
          new officer Mr. Belcher has made here. It may be presumed 
          that he will soon appoint Commissioners of Customes, since 
          he has begun to make officers that none such were ever here 
          before, this Comptroller is son to the new Collector, another 
          son is Deputy Naval Officer, and all concerned in one shop, 
          ships and warehouses. Lett me desire the favour Sir, that 
          a copy of this may be layd before my Lords Commrs. of the 
          Admiralty. My brother will do it if you permit him, and 
          if any part is requisite for the Commissioners of the Customes, 
          I beg the same favour etc. P.S. I told you that Governour 
          Belcher would not permit the Lt. Govr. of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Masachusets</placeName> 
          to sitt in Council with him. Here the Lt. Govrs. allways sat 
          at table and were Councillours by particular mandamus to 
          each, and as I have none such, if the Govr. does not except 
          against my sitting in Council, I must sitt mute there, not having 
          any right to open my mouth, but my goeing to <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Fredericksfort</placeName> 
          will prevent all disputes until I hear from you. It is now 
          Sunday morning the 12th of 7ber. Since yesterday I have been 
          told by several people that Mr. Belcher's friends rejoyce openly 
          at the treatment I met with from the old Judge of the 
          Admiralty, but if he had sayd or done more I had no remedy, 
          all officers and majestrates here refuseing any obedience but 
          to the chief Governour's orders. I had a late instance of this 
          from one of the Sheriffs, who refused to obey my warrant to 
          search for the tobacco beforementioned ; surely the Commissioners
          of the Customes will take some method to prevent such 
          abuses, and not trust shopkeepers and merchants wth. the care 
          of the customes abroad. The Advocate General has given me 
          his opinion that the words absence and return in the clause of 
          Belcher's Comn. etc. must be expounded a personal departure 
          from or a personal presence in the Province etc.

        <p><placeName ref="#en_lon_hampton" role="from">Hampton Court</placeName>.  
          Duke of Newcastle to Major Genl. Hunter. I have 
          received the favour of several of your letters, the last of which 
          is dated the 5th of June, and have laid them all before the King : 
          H.M. was glad to find that the Assembly had resolved to subsist 
          the two regts. for six months more ; but H.M. being willing 
          that his subjects in that island should be eased of that expence 
          as soon as it can be done with safety and convenience to the 
          troops, it not appearing from the accounts that have been 
          received from thence that those Regts. can be of any great 
          use in suppressing the rebellious negroes, intends shortly to 
          order that they should return <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">home</placeName>, and those orders will be 
          dispatcht soon enough, to arrive at <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> about Janry. next, 
          which is thus calculated out of regard to the proper season for 
          their voyage home, and to the health of the officers and men, 
          which might suffer extremely, were they to come home in the 
          depth of the winter ; But of this you are to take no notice, 
          that the soldiers may be the rather induced to accept the bounty 
          that will be offered them to go into the Independt. Companys, 
          and the encouragemt. which it is to be hoped you will be able 
          to procure by an Act of the Assembly for their settling at 
          Jamaica, which must, by the increase of white inhabitants, 
          be a great advantage to the island. That there may be a 
          sufficient force for its security when the regts. are gone, H.M. 
          has sent orders to Lt. Col. Cornwallis, or the Commanding Officer 
          in either of the two regiments to review the two Independt. 
          Companys and to compleat them by draughts to be proportionably 
          made out of the two Regts., of such soldiers as shall be 
          willing to serve in the sd. companys, to whom, as an 
          encouragemt., a bounty of 10£. sterling a man is to be paid upon 
          their being entered in the said companys, by the respective 
          Captains thereof, out of the non-effective money lying in their 
          hands ; and their wives, as well as those of the soldiers that 
          shall be willing to become inhabitants, are to be sent to them 
          at H.M. expence, if they desire it ; But tho' the King would 
          have all means of persuasion and encouragemt. used to engage 
          the soldiers to remain at Jamaica either in H.M. service in the 
          Independt. Companys, or as inhabitants, yet it is H.M. pleasure 
          that they should not be obliged to it by force or constraint, but 
          that it be left to their free choice and option, whether they 
          will do either, or return home with the regts. to which they 
          belong. For your better information and direction, I send you 
          by H.M. command, copys of two reports, upon this subject, 
          of the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations, by which 
          you will see in what manner they propose that such of the 
          soldiers, as shall be willing to remain in the Island, as 
          inhabitants, be encouraged and settled. And accordingly, if 
          the soldiers that shall be fixt in the new settlemts. should 
          want arms for their defence, H.M. in that case is pleased to 
          direct, that they should keep those they now have. The King 
          cannot doubt, that the Assembly will have a due sense of H.M. 
          goodness to them in being graciously pleased to consider their 
          welfare and safety, so far as to spare those men from his own 
          service for the better peopling of the island, and will not be so 
          much wanting to themselves as to neglect contributing what 
          may depend on them, for improving so fair an opportunity to 
          the advantage of their country, which in all probability, may 
          not offer again in the course of many years. As to what is 
          further suggested by the Board of Trade, in relation to the 
          endeavouring to reduce the rebellious negroes to H.M. obedience 
          by fair means, you will take the best methods you can to discover 
          the disposition of their ring-leaders, and those who have the 
          most credit and influence among them, and if you find it to be 
          such, that they may by persuasion and good usage be made 
          good subjects to H.M., you will learn in what manner, and upon 
          what terms this may be accomplisht, whether by giving them 
          a settlement in <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="indirect">some of the uninhabited islands in America</placeName> 
          belonging to H.M., as is mentioned in the enclosed report, 
          which if you find practicable you will make the necessary 
          dispositions for it, or whether it may be put into any other 
          method that will equally answer the same end, in which case, 
          as well as in the other, you will prepare matters for it, without 
          wayting for further orders from hence. And in the execution 
          of H.M. commands contained in this letter, you will conform 
          yourself to what is proposed by the Board of Trade as far as 
          may be agreable to the directions which I have given you by 
          H.M. order. You will see by this letter, that it is H.M. 
          intention, as soon as it is consistent with the safety of the 
          troops, to send for them home ; but at the same time to provide 
          for the security of the Island by compleating the Independent 
          Companys up to their full complement, and by encouraging 
          the private men of the two regts. to settle in the island and 
          become planters, which must be of the greatest advantage by 
          adding so considerably to the number of white inhabitants, 
          which at present is so very small. H.M. does therefore expect 
          of you, that, without having any view to the keeping of the 
          regts. in the island, you should without loss of time, take the 
          proper measures, in conjunction with Lt. Col. Cornwallis, or 
          the Officer Commanding in Chief the two regts., to engage the 
          soldiers, in consideration of the ten pound bounty, which is to 
          be given each, to enter into the Independt. Companys, and 
          also use your utmost endeavours to induce the Assembly 
          forthwith to give all proper encouragemt. to such others, as 
          may be willing to settle in this island and become planters. 
          I wish I could have sent you H.M. approbation of your conduct 
          relating to the two Regts., before and since their arrival at 
          Jamaica ; and I must particularly take notice to you, that the 
          King expected to have had from you a full account of everything 
          that past either in the Council or Assembly upon this 
          subject, whereby H.M. might have been the better able to 
          judge of the necessity of continuing them in that island, or 
          not, and more fully informed of the sense and opinion of his 
          subjects there in this respect. The King has received an 
          account from other hands, that the Assembly had sent a message 
          to the Council, whenever they expressed themselves in a dutyfull 
          manner towards H.M., but seemed plainly to be of opinion 
          that the regts. were not necessary for the safety of the island, 
          nor would be of any service towards suppressing the rebellious 
          negroes, otherwise than by permitting the soldiers to become 
          settlers. H.M. was surpriz'd that you take no notice of this 
          in any of your letters ; and I send you a copy of the message 
          itself, that you may see the foundation there is for mentioning 
          it to you. Signed, Holles Newcastle. Endorsed, Duplicates sent,

        <p>412. i. Message from the Assembly to the Council of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName>. 
          The House have disagreed to the amendments proposed 
          by your Honours' message of yesterday to the Address 
          to His Majesty. 1st. For the inserting the word, 
          'Will', instead of the word, 'May', is taking upon us 
          affirmitively to assert that that will be which may not 
          and which we are the more inclined to fear may not 
          be, unless by permitting the soldiers to become settlers, 
          because we neither find that any of the rebel negroes 
          have hitherto been killed or taken by them, nor are 
          we convinc'd that they [are] so well able to endure the 
          inconveniencys of passing through the woods, as men 
          more seasoned to the climate. 2ndly. For that as no 
          such necessity as yet appears to us at all, but on the 
          other hand it appears by the Minutes of the last 
          Assembly, within 10 months last past that on consideration 
          for a motion for inviting a body of regular 
          troops, the house did reject the motion and resolved 
          that the bringing over of families and providing for 
          them would be the most effectual method of settling 
          the island, and accordingly did pass a bill entitled 
          an Act to oblige the inhabitants to provide themselves 
          with a sufficient number of white people in proportion 
          to their number of negroes and values of their estates 
          to be sent out and barracked in proper places to reduce 
          the rebellious negroes and encourage the further 
          settling the island, which had your Honours agreed 
          to would annually have brought into the island an 
          additional number of 800 men, at the same expence 
          the subsisting these two regiments are to the island, 
          and reduced the rebellious negroes. Nor hath this 
          house in providing a subsistance for the said soldiers 
          been influenced so much by apprehensions of danger 
          as by the defence to H.M., and their unwillingness 
          to let so many gallant officers and soldiers want any 
          necessaries, until such time as H.M. might be informed of our inability to 
          bear so great a burthen. Copy. 1 1/2 pp. [C.O. 137, 53. ff. 372-376v.]</p>

          to be laid before the King. As soon as they have completed enquiries

        <p>413. i. Same to the King. In obedience to H.M. commands, 
          28th Aug., have considered letters from Mr. Finch relating 
          to an offer by the present Duke of <placeName ref="#lv" role="direct">Courland</placeName> for the sale of 
          <placeName ref="#tobago" role="direct">Tobago</placeName> to the Crown of <placeName ref="#se" role="direct">Sweden</placeName>. 
          Continue : Upon this occasion we beg leave to 
          acquaint your Majesty that heretofore the Dukes 
          of Courland have had their pretentions upon this 
          island founded on a grant made to them by King 
          Charles II in 1664, under certain conditions and 
          services to be performed to the Crown of <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>; 
          But on the other hand, it appears from the ancient 
          books of our Office, that the Dukes of Courland have 
          not comply'd with those stipulations, and we find 
          that when Monsr. de Blomberg, who was Agent for 
          the D. of Courland at this Court in 1686, presented 
          a memorial to the late King James the 2nd, praying 
          H.M. permission that a small number of English 
          families might be at liberty to contract with his master, 
          in order for their settling upon the island of Tobago 
          in conjunction with other families natural subjects of 
          the Duke of Courland, and that the Govr. of <placeName ref="#bb" role="indirect">Barbados</placeName> 
          might receive H.M. Orders to assist ye intended Colony 
          with all that was necessary for their establishment at 
          reasonable prices, Monsr. de Blomberg then received 
          the answer which we have taken the liberty to annex 
          to this representation [v. C.S.P. 1686. No. 1033], 
          by which it appears to have been the opinion of the 
          Lords of the Privy Council in that reign, and likewise 
          of the Attorny General, that the original grant of this 
          island to the Dukes of Courland was void in law. We 
          beg leave therefore to represent to your Majesty, that 
          as nothing has been transacted since this answer was 
          made, wch. can be of any force for the revival of the 
          Duke of Courland's title ; it is to be hoped, his Swedish 
          Majesty will not give ear to any proposal that may be 
          made for the sale of Tobago to the Crown of Sweden 
          which might produce such consequences as would tend 
          to weaken the particular friendship which has so long 
          subsisted between your Majty.'s royal family, and that 
          of His Swedish Majesty, as well as the good 
          understanding and harmony which have been so happily 
          cultivated of late years between the Crowns of Great 
          Britain and Sweden. [C.O. 29, 15. pp. 233-236.]</p>

        <p>Address of the President, Council and Assembly of 
          <placeName ref="#stchristophers" role="direct">St. Christophers</placeName> to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Represent that a trade hath been set on foot and carried on for 
          some years past between the subjects of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> in 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName>, <placeName ref="#us_ri" role="direct">Rhode Island</placeName>
          and other places in <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> and the 
          subjects of the French King in <placeName ref="#mq" role="direct">Martinique</placeName> and other adjacent 
          islands and also with the Dutch in <placeName ref="#sr" role="direct">Surinam</placeName>, which trade tis 
          concerned is contrary to the tenor of a Treaty now subsisting 
          between Great Brittain and <placeName ref="#fr" role="indirect">France</placeName>, the view and designe 
          of all our laws relating to trade and that in this trade the 
          French are furnished by Englishmen with horses, fish, boards, 
          staves and other lumber. These are commoditys absolutely 
          necessary to a Sugar Plantation and had the English made use 
          of the advantage they had in their hands by being possessed 
          of the only places in <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">America</placeName> from whence the French could 
          draw these commoditys either in such quantitys as they wanted 
          or at such rates as they could afford to give and withheld them 
          strictly from them, the difficultys which in that case they would 
          have found themselves under might have checked the design 
          of turning those islands to sugar plantations, at least it must 
          greatly have stopped the progress of it. This as wee apprehend 
          will plainly appear to your Lordshipp when 'tis consider'd what 
          quantitys of sugar Martinique in particular made at any time 
          before the conclusion of the last war (when they had not the 
          means of being furnished with these commoditys) and what 
          they have made since. On the other hand, by neglecting this 
          advantage and permitting this trade to be carried on without 
          restraint the French have settled great numbers of sugar 
          plantations in those islands, are become so populous there as 
          to endanger the security of <placeName ref="#leeward" role="direct">H.M. Leeward Islands</placeName> and if some 
          way cannot be found to stop their progress will soon be able 
          to supply all the marketts in <placeName ref="#europe" role="secondary">Europe</placeName> and become entire masters 
          of the sugar trade. That by allowing this commerce to be 
          carried on by the people of New England, with the French and 
          Dutch, the trade of Great Brittain will suffer in many other 
          branches of it besides the sugar trade, for that the English may 
          and frequently do take forreign commoditys in exchange for 
          their own goods and by that means prevent the consumption 
          of the Brittish manufactures. That besides the danger 
          threatned to Great Brittain in the sugar trade by being 
          ourselves the instruments in forwarding and promoting the 
          settlement of the French and Dutch Colonys and besides the 
          prejudice which may accrue by such a trade to the Brittish 
          manufactures, wee apprehend that this and the rest of H.M. 
          Leeward Islands labour under hardships from it which we hope 
          your Lordships wont think it reasonable for us to suffer especially 
          when it is considered that tho' some advantage may accrue to 
          New England by it yet they are not such as will counterbalance 
          the dammages which the <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="indirect">Sugar Colonys</placeName> suffer and the 
          advantages that are thereby given to a people that are rivals 
          to us in the same trade. For it lessens the consumption of the 
          rum and molasses of the English and increases the consumption 
          of the same manufactures of the French and with this further 
          advantage to them likewise that a great part of the materials 
          which go to the making these manufactures if they could not 
          exchange them with the English would be lost to them. It 
          also lays us under the necessity of buying these commoditys 
          at a dearer price which enables the French to under sell us 
          in our sugars and it drains us of our current coin which is 
          often received by the people of New England from us in 
          payment for the goods they bring, and carried to the French 
          to purchase those commoditys which we ought in reason to 
          furnish them with. That His late Majesty was so sensible of 
          the mischiefs that would ensue to his Sugar Colonys by this 
          trade that it was no sooner known to be sett on foot but he 
          gave the strictest commands to the Governours to be watchfull, 
          and to use their utmost diligence to prevent it. That the 
          Brittish subjects lye under many other disadvantages in the 
          Sugar Trade which at this time may deserve Your Lordshipps' 
          consideration particularly in not being allowed to carry their 
          sugars to any foreign markett till it has first been imported to 
          Great Brittain, which gives the French who are free from any 
          such restriction an oportunity to supply the forreign marketts 
          before us and without the charges of a double voyage which 
          we are lyable to, so that they are enabled to undersell us by 
          at least twenty-five pr. cent., and it is to be feared they not 
          only have this advantage of us in the forreign marketts, but 
          that they do supply some of our own people and particularly 
          Ireland with great part of the sugars they consume etc. Pray 
          the Board to promote the passing of some law in Parliament 
          which may effectually put a stop to a commerce so destructive 
          to the Brittish sugar trade and give new life and vigour to it.

          Return thanks " for the late gracious and seasonable of your paternal and extensive 
          care of the safety and security of this your island in 
          sending over two regiments for our protection against 
          our slaves in rebellion," who are grown more numerous 
          and insolent notwithstanding the almost insupportable 
          expence the country has been at in endeavouring to 
          suppress them. Our loyalty and gratitude your 
          Majesty etc. readily engaged us to endeavour at 
          obtaining an additional subsistance for them on their 
          first arrival here, which has with great difficulty been 
          obtain'd for them by two laws for that purpose, which 
          are to last for twelve months only, and altho' wee 
          humbly conceive their presence and being kept up 
          compleat is now so absolutely necessary for our safety, 
          that if they are withdrawn the negroes (wee fear) 
          would soon be sensible of our weakness and nakedness, 
          and make a fatall use of that opportunity ; yet wee 
          think ourselves bound in duty with all humility to 
          lay before your Majesty the declining condition of 
          this once flourishing Collony occasioned by the entire 
          loss of all our trade with our neighbours, the very low 
          price which our now only staple commodity (sugars) 
          bears in the European marketts, the great and heavy 
          taxes wee have long groaned under for the extirpation 
          of those our cruel intestine enemys, the frequent and 
          dreadfull calamitys wee have suffered from the hand 
          of Heaven, and the daily decrease of our white 
          inhabitants, all which render us very unable to raise 
          a sufficient subsistance for those troops, so seasonably 
          sent us for the security of our lives and fortunes, and 
          gives us great reason to apprehend that at the expiration 
          of the said twelve months, it will not be in our 
          power to prevail with the Assembly here to subsist 
          them for any longer time. Therefore from your 
          Majesty's known indulgence and beneficence to all           
          your people, and the use and advantage this island 
          is of to all your Brittish subjects, wee are embolden'd 
          to become humble suitors to your Majesty that you 
          would be graciously pleased to continue those troops 
          here for our safety and protection, and in your royal 
          wisdom to take such methods for their additional 
          subsistance as may be for the ease of your subjects the

          received again advice from the Speaker of that Province that 
          they are much in want of the Act for emitting a paper currantsy 
          (to enable the inhabitants to support their Governour discharge 
          their engagements in the loan office etc. ) : their Province is situated between 
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="indirect">New York</placeName> and <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="indirect">Pensilvania</placeName>
          and their paper money being currant in each, occasions the dispersing it through 
          the whole and it's scarce a third part of it continues in their Province so 
          that they found 40,000£. was full little enough to maintain a 
          currantsey and carry on a trade, much the greater part of which 
          (as they write) is now sunk and the Act which raised it requiring 
          that those who borrowed it should pay it in agein in the same 
          specie, put the borrowers under very great difficulties to procure 
          it, and those difficulties will yearly augment by the sinking of the 
          said bills, therefore as well for carrying on our comerce with 
          their neighbours maintaining a trade among themselves as to 
          discharge their engagements in the loan offices a further quantity 
          of money seems absolutely necessary. Signed, p. Richd. Partridge. Endorsed,

          <placeName ref="#ca_nl_placentia" role="from">Placentia</placeName>, Sept. 10, 1731. Sr. We take the liberty 
          to lay before your honour the grievances that we have 
          suffered during your absence these two last winters 
          by evil-minded people who distroyed and puled down 
          all our houses, cook rooms, wharfs and stages, which 
          is very distructive to our fishing voyages the ensueing 
          season and is of fatal consequence to the Fishery. 
          The new Justices we trusted and believed wo'ld have 
          taken some care to prevent such disorders by themselves 
          or some proper persons. But we were mistaken, 
          two of them being abroad in <placeName ref="#europe" role="secondary">Europe</placeName> and the other 
          sick at home. They wo'ld insinuate that the troops 
          in the Garrison were blameable on this head, therefore 
          we pray your Honour will represent this to the 
          Secretary that the Garrison may be supplyed with 
          coal in lieu of wood for their fires and suffer the soldiers 
          to patrole soe in the winter as may prevent the distruction 
          of our sd. houses and wharfs etc., the loss 
          whereof is very great to our owners and a hindrance

        <p><placeName ref="#ca_nl_stjohns" role="from">Salisbury, St. John's</placeName>. 
          Governor Clinton to [? Mr. Popple]. Sir, In my former of the 
          25th July last, I acquainted you of my arrival <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">here</placeName>, 
          and that I was proceeding to <placeName ref="#ca_nl_placentia" role="direct">Placentia</placeName>, to veiw that 
          Garrison, (of which I have transmitted the report) and to 
          adjust the differences that might happen thereabout, all which 
          I have settled in the best manner I was capable, tho' these are 
          a set of people that no one person living can please ; but I need 
          not give their Lordships the trouble to represent them, Capt. 
          Osborn having often repeated it : However the copys of the 
          several petitions, letters and affidavits, that have occurred to 
          me during my Government and command this season, together 
          with some material orders I issued thereon, will I hope be 
          sufficient to convince their Lordships how difficult, and almost impossible
          it is, to govern such a sort of people under the present establishment. 
          The Admirals do really take so much upon themselves, that 
          unless it be to serve their own turns, (or to get a reward as I 
          am very well informed they have) they cannot be prevailed upon 
          to hold a Court, to serve the injured and distressed, of which I 
          have complained to them in my letter of the 23rd past, since 
          which they have held one Court, and at my desire will hold 
          another the 2d instant. They do in general, publickly declare, 
          they are supported in what they do, by an act of Parliament ; 
          and that it is not in the power of his Majesty to grant a 
          commission, or settle any civil power here. The ignorant people are 
          possess'd therewith ; their orders are obeyed, and mine tore, 
          and those I send them by very much abused ; two whereof are 
          now imprison'd here, in order to be tryed the next Quarter 
          Sessions for their contempt. Their Lordships will also find 
          (by a copy of the Representation, the Justices of this place 
          have sent me) the inconveniency and hazard the island is 
          exposed to, by the transportation of felons to this part of 
          <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">America</placeName>, and the number of Irish Papists that resort here in 
          the Fishing season, and remain the winter, both which (I must 
          concurr with the Justices in opinion) are of dangerous consequence. 
          Several of the felons lately brought over, have been 
          guilty of theft, and threatned murder to the very masters they 
          lived with, tho' Justices ; whose account thereof I also send 
          a copy. The Irish are grown so insolent, that they openly 
          declare, they wish for nothing else, but the French to come 
          over, and they will join them directly ; for there is not one but 
          has his fire-arms. They are very much supported by one Rowe 
          at the Bay of Bulls, an English Papist, and master of a ship, 
          who takes upon him to determine everything in their favour 
          (tho' no Admiral) of whose transactions I have inclosed a part, 
          for their Lordships perusal. And now at my departure, I have 
          been crowded with numberless complaints ; and certainly such 
          barbarous, unjust and scandalous behaviour to one another, 
          was never seen in a Christian country. The Admirals, master 
          and leading trading people, seem, I think, to devour the rest ; 
          they send their boats, take the people's effects by force from 
          their flakes and stages, without any regard to the other 
          creditors, nay even giving the owners the satisfaction to see 
          it weighed, or knowing what is taken from them. Upon which 
          I published my order of the 24th instant (which is at the 
          conclusion of my remonstrances) that all might know I was 
          determined to put a stop to such base and vile proceedings, one 
          towards another, and partly the methods by which I intended 
          it. I shall always make it my study to execute H.M. commands 
          to the utmost of my power, and my endeavours here has been 
          to do justice to all partys without partiality. But unless their 
          Lordships will please to consider of some more effectual means, 
          to redress the many greivances I have represented, it will be 
          impossible for me to regulate this Fishery to the strictness of 
          my Commission, and much less can the Justices and other 
          civil Power be supposed to rule, that are to act under me. I 
          shall defer what I have further to say till such time I have the 
          honour to wait on their Lordships myself etc. Signed, Geo. Clinton.

          In reply to H.M. commands quotes clauses in Newfoundland Act 
          relating to the process of Fishing Admirals etc. 
          Continues : Whereby it appears that the whole 
          authority granted to the Fishing Admirals is restrained 
          to the seeing the rules and orders, contained in that 
          Act, concerning the regulation of the Fishery there 
          duely put in execution and to the determination of 
          differences arising between the masters of fishing- 
          boats and the inhabitants, or any by-boat keeper 
          touching the right and property of fishing rooms, 
          stages, flakes or any other building or conveniency 
          for fishing or curing of fish in the several harbours or 
          coves of <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName>, which is a kind of civil 
          jurisdiction in particular cases of property ; whereas 
          the authority of Justices of the Peace extends only 
          to breaches of the Peace and other criminal matters ; 
          and therefore I am humbly of opinion that the powers 
          granted by your Majesty to Capt. Osborne to constitute 
          Justices of the Peace in Newfoundland is not contrary 
          to or inconsistent with any of the provisions in the 
          said Act, and that there is no interfering between the 
          powers given by that act to the Fishing Admirals and 
          the authorities which Justices of the Peace are invested 
          with by their Commission. Signed, P. Yorke.

          served as Justices of the Peace without complaint for 
          3 years ; but this morning saw a most scandalous 
          complaint given in by Lawrence Herder and others, 
          laying before you, that they were most barbarously 
          used by us, and that we connived with some New 
          Englanders to their great hurt, and also imposed upon 
          them very much by making them pay 45s. yearly for 
          their licences. They all sell beer etc. and keep 
          victualling houses, and it is no hardship to them to 
          pay such a small summe, necessary for repairing the 
          Church and mending the road to Little Placentia etc. 
          Request to resign their Commissions. 
          
          (i) Order by Governor Clinton to the Justices at

          house, and take security for his good behaviour, " and

          business behave themselves disrespectively " etc. 
          For the future 20s. and no more is to be demanded 
          for granting and renewing licences to public houses 
          etc., and an exact account to be kept etc. 
          
          (j) Governor Clinton to the Justices of the Peace 
          within the district of <placeName ref="#ca_nl_trinity" role="direct">Trinity</placeName>. St. Johns, 22nd Aug., 
          1731. Has made a new Commission, leaving out 
          Jacob Tavernor on account of his being a Dissenter, 
          " and some other disturbances he has been guilty of," 
          and putting in his room Richard Waterman, who is 
          to take the oath before Lt. Hughes, whom he has 
          appointed to go to the norward, in order to settle things 
          in the best manner he is capable of. The Justices are 
          all jointly to act in the said Commission, and " not 
          one to have more power than another, nor one to 
          contradict what another orders, it being impossible to keep 
          up any manner of Government when any such divisions happen." 
          
          (k) Same to Same. Mr. Kilpatrick having reported 
          that there are no Churchwardens for the Church of Trinity, 
          they are to hold a meeting for the election of same. Dated as preceding. 
          
          (l) Governor Clinton to Lt. Richard Hughes, H.M.S. 
          Salisbury. Instructions to proceed to several harbours, 
          and there assist fishing admirals, determine disputes, 
          prevent illegal trade, punish offenders, obtain information 
          for answers to Heads of Enquiry etc., and prevent 
          any foreign vessel fishing in these parts, with due regard 
          to Articles 13 and 14 of Treaty of Utrecht. Dated as preceding. 
          
          (m) Justices of the Peace of <placeName ref="#ca_nl_stjohns" role="direct">St. Johns</placeName> to Governor 
          Clinton. 20th Aug. 1731. Represent the difficultys 
          they meet with and the insults they are exposed to 
          in the execution of their Commission etc., and other 
          grievances, which if not speedily prevented, must 
          destroy the present establishment etc. Continue : 
          In the first place we humbly present the danger the 
          country is in, and will be more exposed to, in case of 
          a French war, by the bringing hither such a number 
          of Irish Roman Catholicks, being 300 or more every 
          year, insomuch that three quarters of the inhabitants, 
          on the So. and West part of the Island, are of that 
          sort, and who, we have very good reason to think, 
          will to a man join the French interests, as they have 
          opportunity, which will soon be given them by the 
          French from <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="direct">Cape Briton</placeName>, whenever a war happens ; 
          those people from Ireland being all Papists, brought 
          from inland places, and many from gaols, very ignorant 
          and insolent, and naturally prejudiced against 
          Englishmen and Protestants ; and the ill consequence 
          attending their setling here in such numbers is most 
          apparent. We also desire to represent the danger we 
          are exposed to by the transportation of felons, from 
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="secondary">Great Briton</placeName> hither ; which before this year hath not 
          been known, and since which five of the basest and 
          most barbarous murders have been commited, that 
          ever was known in this Island, and not without strong 
          suspicion of its being done by some of them etc. As 
          we are a Constitution not so capable of defending 
          ourselves from such insults, as others of H.M. Planta- 
          tions, which are under better regulations, and have 
          men and money for defence and security thereof at 
          the publick charge, we pray that the fear we are in 
          from such bandits may be removed, by their being 
          obliged to depart this island etc. Represent the charge 
          and difficulty of sending to <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> for trial persons 
          charged with capital crimes, with witnesses etc., the 
          persons so offending generally having nothing to 
          forfeit, the charge must be levied on the people of the 
          district, in which they are convicted ; which how 
          hard, or even impossible it is to be done, is obvious 
          to all who are acquainted with the indigent condition 
          of the people here ; then after all, the charges must 
          be paid by us who act, or imploy any person in such 
          an affair, and without any reward, credit or thanks etc.  
          By an order from Governor Osborn, a tax was levyed 
          in 1729 of half a quintal of merchantable fish on all 
          fishing boats, and half a quintal on all boats' rooms, 
          within this district, towards erecting a prison in St. 
          John's. The said prison was began, in expectation 
          that the tax would have been duly complyed with ; but 
          several have refused to pay, and upwards of 50£. hath 
          been advanced towards the said building, above what 
          hath been reced. for that service, and no prospect at 
          present of having the same reimbursed. And as some 
          are poor and cannot, and some refuse to pay, it was 
          thought the most proper method this year, to rate 
          three pence on the pound on all servants' wages, 
          imployed in the Fishery (exclusive of the shipping) 
          to finish the said prison, and that all masters should 
          account for the number of their servants and detain 
          in their hands threepence per pound out of their 
          wages etc. Which good intentions of ours meets with 
          unjust censures, and insinuations are spread abroad 
          that the money so raised, will be converted to our own 
          use, and both masters and servants refuse to comply 
          therewith, being thereto influenced by the Admirals, 
          and most of the masters of vessels in the harbour, so 
          that unless you will please by some severe methods 
          to oblige them to their duty etc. the prison must remain 
          unfinished ; and those who have advanced so much 
          money be great sufferers, and our persons and office 
          contemned and ridiculed etc. Pray H.E. to secure 
          for them an explanation of the Act of Parliament 
          relating to the Trade and Fishery of Newfoundland, 
          in particular of the extent of power given to the 
          Admirals, " and for instructions how we are to proceed 
          in the execution of our office, without interferring 
          with the power granted to them thereby." Signed, 
          Willm. Weston, A. Southmayd.
          
          (n) Governor Clinton to the Collectors for the 
          Prison at St. Johns. Salisbury at St Johns, 27th 
          Aug. 1731. Calls for accounts, and of " who has 
          not paid to the prison " etc. Continues : The three- 
          pence laid on the head of each servant, (v. preceding), 
          is quite against the rules laid down by Capt. Osborn 
          etc. To raise what was laid first will be sufficient etc. 
          I will give you till to-morrow sennight to fix everything etc. 
          
          (o) Same to the Justices of the Peace at Conception 
          Bay. 31st Aug., 1731. Capt. Weston has given me 
          a list of what people have paid in <placeName ref="#by_conception" role="direct">Conception Bay</placeName>
          towards the prison here, but tells me there is a great 
          many more wanting yet ; therefore I desire you will 
          immediately oblige the rest to do the same etc. 
          Whereas there is several more boats this year, I expect 
          the same from all equally. Lt. Hughes has instructions 
          to oblige those who refuse to pay to you etc. 
          
          (p) Same to Lt. Hughes. Aug. 31st. Instructions referred to in preceding.

          your servant, Garret Haley according to your contract etc. 
          
          (s) Same to the Collectors for the Prison. St. 
          Johns, 2nd Sept. The progress you have made in 
          collecting the money I very much approve of etc. 
          Encloses notices for hastening on this business etc. 
          
          (t) Same to Lt. Hughes, 8th Sept., 1731. Le Merkin 
          and his son having presumed to tear in pieces my 
          order, and treat the constables inhumanly, who read 
          it to him, and beat his servant, you are to bring them 
          hither prisoners, to answer for contempt. 
          
          (u) Thomas Hibbs and Robert R. M. Miller, 
          Constables, to William Weston, J.P. Portugal Cove, 
          7th Sept., 1731. We have served Nicholas Merkins 
          with the Comadore's order the which they abused 
          and broke, and likewise beat and abused the man for 
          craving of anything for his labour etc.

          1731. Whereas complaint has been made to me, that 
          you are indebted to divers persons at this place, and 
          are clandestinly getting off your fish etc., without any 
          regard to the demands of your creditors, I do therefore 
          strictly forbid you to dispose of it etc., till you have 
          appeared at the Court I am to hold here on Tuesday next etc.

          being determined not to be on ship's room, as alleged 
          by Richard Newman and John Lyston, master of fishing

          etc. Signed, G. Clinton, H. Osborn, Heard, Admiral, Squarry, do. 
          
          (z) Governor Clinton to the Fishing Admirals at 
          St. Johns. Salisbury at St. John's. 23rd Sept., 
          1731. Upon my arrival, I declared I should not sit 
          at any Court ashoar ; but that in complyance with 
          the Act of Parliament, I should be always ready to 
          hear any appeal, that might be made to me on board 
          the Salisbury, from any person that judged himself 
          aggreived by your sentence. But as I am daily 
          pestered with complaints of masters being ill treated by 
          their servants, and servants wronged by their masters 
          etc., it makes me so free to say that I think you have 
          been very negligent in the discharge of that duty 
          incumbent on you ; that is, the speedy hearing such 
          complaints, and doing justice to the injured party. 
          It is therefore my opinion that you ought, and desire 
          that you will forthwith hold a Court, to hear and 
          decide so many controversyes, as are ready to come 
          before you. Once more I recommend this affair to 
          you as a matter of moment, and the rather for that 
          the Peace and welfare of the inhabitants, as well as 
          free trade and commerce, intirely depends upon it, 
          and expect your complyance. Otherwise I must be 
          obliged to represent so great a negligence of yours to 
          the Lords Commissrs. for Trade, and pray them, 
          to think of some more effectual means, to releive the 
          distressed, and distribute justice.

          1731. Whereas great complaints have been made of 
          forcible seizures for debts, without authority, by which 
          illegal practices masters are disabled from paying their 
          servants' wages, and the poor servants are reduced 
          to beggary etc., and whereas it appears that several 
          of the inhabitants proceed in a very scandalous manner 
          towards each other, and frequently combine with 
          persons to secretly convey their effects off their rooms, 
          at the conclusion of the fishing season, under pretence 
          of answering, as well their fallacious and contrived, 
          as real debts, to the great prejudice if not utter ruin 
          of others, etc., I am determined to put a stop to these 
          illegal proceedings etc., and hereby strictly forbid any 
          person whatsoever, to enter upon, or take from any 
          flake, stage etc. in the manner aforesaid any fish, oil, 
          or other goods, without first obtaining permission 
          from me etc., on pain of forfeiting double the quantity 
          of goods so taken away etc. In the case of all debts 
          hereafter contracted, particular regard will be had to the

          me with your warrant for her husband's servant, that 
          he shipt out of Mr. Simon Cricket, Commander of the 
          ship Society, which I suppose had full power to act 
          and do for the good of the voyage ensuing, for the 
          interest of his outsetters in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, and as he was 
          entered Master in England by H.M. Custom-House 
          Officers, I think he may act and do for the interest of 
          his imployers, and not be controuled by any person 
          here in our destitute parish of Bay Bulls. But it's 
          my opinion Mr. Geo. Rowe, that a man of your profession 
          hath no authority to grant warrants amongst us Protestants, 
          without a power and authority from King George, or his 
          directions, by his worthy subjects etc., and not for to 
          have no arbitrary power amongst us, which God strengthen us 
          against ; I hope King and Country will stand against all 
          such who point towards it etc. Signed, Nathl. Brooks. 
          
          (e) Capt. Rowe to N. Brooks. I shall not take 
          much time to answer your nonsense. As to Mr. 
          Critchett, he is follow my directions and none but 
          mine, and as for arbitrary Government, God forbid 
          it should lye in your power etc. I do admire who 
          gave any such fellow as you, orders to act or dispute 
          in any manner of justice, altho' you have had the 
          impertinence of doing it, without either act of Parliament, 
          or orders to the Government. P.S. The fellow shall not serve 
          Julian without security for his passage. Signed, Geo. Rowe. 
          
          (f) N. Brooks to Capt. Weston. Bay Bulls. 13th 
          May, 1731 . Asks for his opinion what to do concerning 
          preceding. Continues : Julian shipt a passenger that 
          came over with Simon Critchet and cloathed him, 
          and hath been with Julian ever since without any 
          demand for his passage, or anything else. But now 
          Capt. Rowe wanting hands, would take the man away 
          from Julian. The man is in the country with his 
          master, and Capt, Rowe swears as soon as the man 
          comes out he will send a file of musketeers after him, 
          and carry him to the publick whipping post, and whip 
          him within an inch of his life, if he will not serve him 
          etc. As for Capt. Rowe being an Admiral, I hope you'l give 
          your opinion in that, he being no master of a ship, Benj. Jelly 
          being master of the ship he came over in etc. Signed, Nathl. Brooks. 
          
          (g) W. Weston and A. Southmayd to N. Brooks. 
          St. John's, 15th May, 1731. Are of opinion that as 
          Julian shipt the man from Capt. Critchet before Capt. 
          Rowe arrived, it is not in his power now to take him 
          away, Julian finding such security for his passage as 
          may be satisfactory to Capt. Critchet or Capt. Rowe, 
          though by what we find Capt. Rowe hath nothing to 
          do in the matter. As to his acting as Admiral, if 
          Benj. Gelly cleared the ship in the Custom-House 
          in England, he is master, and Capt. Rowe hath no 
          power to act as such etc. If he etc. disputes your 
          authority for acting as Constable in Bay Bulls, regard 
          them not, but continue so to do according to the 
          Instructions you have received from us etc. Signed,

          Lt. Governor Gledhill to the Duke of Newcastle. 
          Words cannot paint the distress and distraction of this callamatious 
          place, occasioned by a dre'full fire, which broak out 
          yesterday morning and in the space of an hour, consumed the 
          best of our houses, in <placeName ref="#ca_nl_placentia" role="direct">this town</placeName>, to ashes, and upwards of 70 
          thousand weight of bread and 180 thousand weight of flower

          vigellance of the troops of this garrison (which God knows is 
          but 36 men) in blowing up the houses and extenguishing the 
          fire, not only the whole town, but the garrison, also, had been 
          in ashes. This ship being under sail I have only time, so far, 
          to pay my duty to your Lordship, in this short acct., and farther 
          to acquaint yr. Lordship that on the 15th of last month, I had

          Lt. Governor Armstrong to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. I take this opportunity, being the first that my 
          health would permitt me to embrace since my arrival, to 
          acquaint your Lordships of my return hither, in obedience to 
          H.M. directions etc. Will always strictly comply with his 
          Instructions etc., " and what other your Lordships may at any 
          time judge proper to send me, for my farther help in promoting 
          H.M. interest, in this much neglected (and as I may venture to 
          say) distracted <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Colony</placeName>. Of which, tho' I doubt not Governor 
          Philipps either has, or will give you an account, I also judge 
          it my duty so far to represent the same, and the difficultys 
          which I not only labour under at present, but likely to be farther 
          involved into, without some other advice from your Lordships, 
          for the people (I mean the French) that I have to deal with, 
          are a perfidious, head-strong, obstinate and as conceited a crew 
          as any in the world etc. Governor Philipps having appointed 
          Major Cosby, the Lt. Governor of the Garrison, President of 
          the Council, in prejudice of Major Paul Mascarene, and other 
          senior Members, who complain highly of it as a peice of injustice ; 
          I have thought therefore proper, to lay the same before your
          Lordships, for your determination, otherways I shall not have 
          a Council, because the Gentlemen insist upon sitting and taking 
          place at the Board, according to their senioritys, and are of 
          opinion, that the eldest Counsellor is always he that should 
          be president, or at least ought to succeed as such, upon which,
          I hope your Lordships will favour me with your opinion" etc. 
          Refers to encl. ii. Continues : Since Governor Philipps left this 
          place, the 27th of August last, I have been favoured with a 
          letter from His Grace the Duke of Newcastle in relation to 
          pyrats, as also one from Mr. Secretary Popple with the Sollicitor 
          and Attorney General's opinion upon fines and recovery etc. 
          Several people having petitioned for grants etc. finds by their 
          letter 20th May, 1730, he is restricted from giving any till Col. 
          Dunbar has first set apart 300,000 acres for H.M. Continues : 
          I must beg leave to observe to your Lordships, that delays in 
          doing of it, may still retard the settling of the Province, especially 
          of this part of it, and other adjacent places in the <placeName ref="#by_fundy" role="direct">Bay of Fundy</placeName>, 
          and also at <placeName ref="#ca_ns_canso" role="direct">Canso</placeName>. But it's hoped that these restrictions respect 
          only to woodlands proper for masting, or even if the method 
          of townships (tho' by far the best) is to be strickly observed. 
          Your Lordships in your forerecited letter, have a just notion 
          of our French inhabitants. But as they have taken the oath 
          of fidelity, and thereby admitted to the priviledges and liberty 
          of subjects, I beg your Lordships to inform me, how far they 
          or their seigniors are intitled to lands abandon'd ever since the 
          reduction of this place, and other waste and uncultivated lands, 
          to which, especially since their taking the oath they lay claim, 
          and plead the Treaty of Utrecht, tho' for these many years 
          noways cultivated or improven, which if they are to enjoy 
          without a limitation of certain conditions, the country will in 
          a great measure remain a wilderness, and there will be scarce 
          one acre left, especially in this place, to be granted to Protestant 
          subjects, who are much desired, and for whom room might be 
          found here, if these Seigniors did not thus pretend a right to 
          the greatest part, if not the whole Province, without complying 
          with such conditions, as may be naturally conjectur'd, that 
          first moved his most Christian Majesty to make such concessions, 
          which, if not remedy'd, will render this part of the Province a 
          continual expence, and of no advantage to H.M., for whose use, 
          there is not an inhabitant that pays a farthing rent, towards 
          the defraying of such necessary charges that attends all 
          Governments. As to which the Gentlemen of the Council, who 
          are daily employ'd and harras'd with their affairs, (their being 
          no other Court of Judicature) do, and that not without reason 
          complain, in whose behalf I humbly recommend to your Lordships, 
          to send us a table of fees, both in that respect, and the 
          giving of grants, for wax and all other kinds of stationary ware 
          here is very dear and expensive, and it's hoped that an annual 
          supply thereof, may be ordered us from <placeName ref="#gb" role="secondary">Britain</placeName>. I must also 
          beg leave to recommend to your Lordships the necessity 
          of having the French inhabitants' estates survey'd and measur'd, 
          because otherways it will be impossible ever to lay before your 
          Lordships, any just plan of this country, for its said that some, 
          if not all, of them possess and claim greater tracts, than they 
          are anyways intitled to, and in case you approve thereof, I 
          desire you will signify the same, and who is to be at the expence 
          of so doing, and whether it is not necessary, as they refuse to 
          renew and take grants from the Government, that their French 
          grants should be recorded. They are a very ungovernable 
          people, and growing very numberous and the method of treating 
          with them upon any subject, is by their Deputys, of whom with 
          the Council etc., till supply'd with more proper members, if 
          there might be a smal Assembly constituted, they in time may 
          be perhaps brought through their own free and voluntary acts 
          to pay a greater obedience to the Government, and contribute 
          to its support, and as Civil Magistrates are much wanted, I 
          intreat your Lordships directions for appointing, at least some 
          Justices of the Peace, and other inferior officers amongst them, 
          to act in things, especially, that may relate to themselves, with 
          such decorum as may oblige them still farther to depend upon 
          the Government, by giving us information of the behaviour 
          and clandestine proceedings of the rest. I have signifyed to 
          your Lordships, that there are several people who have 
          petitioned for grants, some of them are for smal plotts, in and 
          adjacent to this town for houses and gardens, and others for tracts for farms, at
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns_minas" role="direct">Mines</placeName>, but especially by several young people, who have
          setled themselves, some years agoe, at a place called <placeName ref="#ca_nb_shepody" role="direct">Chippody</placeName>
          in the Bay ; not far from <placeName ref="#ca_ns_chignecto" role="indirect">Chickenectua</placeName>, where, 
          if upon the Surveyor's report there is no woods proper for 
          masting, I presume grants may be made out for the same, 
          without being interpreted a breach of any article of the 
          Instructions, tho' not laid out exactly in the same form as there 
          directed, which I shall recommend to the Surveyor to do, as 
          near as circumstances will permitt. These people's petitions 
          were recommended by Governor Philipps before his departure, 
          to the consideration of the Council, who finding some disputes 
          were amongst them, defer'd the same till these differences were 
          accomodated, and for that purpose Governor Philipps by 
          Proclamation signifyed it to them, and appointed them by the 
          10th of Aprile next, to appear to make out their respective 
          claims. I am so far, my Lords, of opinion, that if grants be 
          given to these new planters, that the others may be thereby 
          induced to renew their old grants, and hold immediately of 
          H.M., and not off these Seigniors, who, in my opinion have 
          forfeited their rights, through non-performance of the conditions. 
          But if in this I differ from your Lordships, I still think it 
          necessary, that these Seigniors should at least renew their 
          grants, and pay the appointed quitt-rent etc. to H.M., which 
          I think is but just, seeing they receive their rents annually 
          from the other inhabitants, as to which likewise I beg your 
          Lordships' advice. Ever since the reduction of this place there 
          hath been strange jugling amongst these Seigniors, as well as 
          the other inhabitants, who, as heirs, pretend a right of possession 
          to the estates of those who left the country even at the 
          Capitulation, and others pretend to have bought of those that went 
          away, by virtue of her late Majesty's letter, dated 23rd June 
          1713 ; 'Tis true that Her Majesty gives liberty to such of the 
          French as had a mind, to retire into the bounds and dominions 
          of the French King, to sell their estates, but it's presumed only, 
          those who had remain'd in the Province till that time, were 
          intitled to the advantages therein mentioned, and not those 
          who had abandon'd and left their estates, at the reduction of 
          the place, in 1710. In relation to which, there being several 
          disputes, I must intreat your Lordships' opinion, in order to 
          decide the same ; If H.M. letter can be interpreted to all in 
          general, certain it is, that we shall never be without Seigniours, 
          whereas, if only in favour of such as were then in the country, 
          part of these Seigniors' estates now belong to H.M., and I have 
          been told, that rents have been remitted from hence to some 
          in the Dominions of <placeName ref="#fr" role="secondary">France</placeName>, which tho it may be forbid cannot 
          be easily prevented here, no more than their clandestine trade 
          with the people of <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="direct">Cape Breton</placeName>, whither they transport annually 
          above 3 or 400 head of cattle, besides sheep and other provisions, 
          to the great prejudice of this province, which can only be 
          prevented by having a sloop to cruise upon the Eastern coast 
          and in the <placeName ref="#by_verte" role="direct">Bay of Vert</placeName>. As I do not presume to the knowledge 
          of forms for grants, I have therefore presum'd, to order a copy 
          of one, used by Governor Philipps, for your Lordships' perusal, 
          to be laid before you, and I hope to be favour'd with your advice, 
          whether I may follow the same, or have a more formal one sent 
          me. As to Canso I have been inform'd, that there are more fish 
          this year than there are vessells to carry it to markett, and that 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Col. Dunbar's settlements</placeName>, where there is a detachment of men 
          from this regiment, improve daily. But of these, they being

        <p>Address of the Assembly of <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">Barbados</placeName> to the King. 
          We etc. humbly begg leave with gratefull hearts to give your 
          Majesty our unfeigned thanks for your Majesty's great goodness 
          to us in removeing Coll. Henry Worsley from the government 
          of this Island. Many and great were the hardships and heavy 
          were the greivances that this your Majesty's Colony lay under for 
          severall years last past under the administration of that Gentleman,
          who not content with an extravagant settlement of 7,800£. 
          a year (which on his arrivall here, taking advantage of the then 
          unsetled state of the times, he procured the publick to submitt 
          to) omitted no art or means whatsoever to improve his 
          advantages over them, and extorted many large summs of 
          money from them, and made the Island no further his care than 
          as it contributed to his private profit, and farr from promoting 
          it's good ever opposed everything that tended thereto, and 
          then debarred the opprest inhabitants the liberty, which all 
          your Majesty's other Colonyes enjoy, of having Agents in 
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> to preferr their complaints and represent their 
          grievances to your Majesty, on whose paternall care and royall clemency 
          they depend. This the sd. late Governour effected by his 
          management with the members of your Majesty's Councill, 
          too many of whom seem to have thought it their duty to pay 
          a blind obedience to his will, and thro' the fear of an immediate 
          suspension in case of any non-complyance with his interests 
          or passions were influenc'd to the meanest submissions, and 
          acted as if they had been indispensably bound to concurr with 
          him in every attempt of his on the libertyes and propertyes 
          of the poor inhabitants of this island, and in order to favour 
          H.E.'s vexatious pretensions and demands on the publick have 
          even ventured to affirm, in a late address to your sacred Majesty, 
          that they are not sensible of any poverty in this your Majestye's 
          island, but what has been occasioned only by personall 
          extravaganzes, whereas 'tis most notoriously apparent that the 
          wealth and strength of this island has for some years last past 
          been continually declining, and that its trade is at present on 
          so bad a foot that it must soon be intirely lost if some immediate 
          remedy be not applyed ; But the late signall instance of your 
          Majestye's grace to the island in recalling Coll. Worsley (by 
          whose removall a heavy annuall tax, too heavy indeed to be 
          longer born, is at length determined) encourages us to hope still 
          greater marks of your Royall favour, and that by your Majestye's 
          continued goodness to us this Colony will not only be preserved 
          from the ruin now impending over it but he restored to a 
          flourishing condition under the dominion of the best of Kings. 
          Wee ardently implore the Allmighty God to grant your Majesty 
          health, wealth and length of dayes, and that the British Empire 
          may be for ever established in your Majesty and your august house. Signed, 
          Robt. Warren, Cl. of the Assembly. 1 large p. [C.O. 28, 45. ff. 199.]</p>

          Governor Hunter to the Duke of Newcastle. Encloses 
          duplicate of Council's Address ; repeats condition of regiments 
          as preceding (v. Sept. 24) (No. 415). Continues : Having by advice 
          of the Council ordered out a party from <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName> to destroy 
          or dislodge the rebel slaves in <placeName ref="#jm_nannytown" role="direct">the neighbourhood</placeName> of that place 
          and sent thither the arm'd and baggage negroes as directed by 
          an act of Assembly, sickness or rum has reduced these five 
          companys to such a pass that, as the Commanding Officer there 
          writes, he has not twenty men able to march. I have ordered 
          a reinforcement of thirty men from this side to embark on 
          board one of H.M. ships forthwith for Port Antonio, that the 
          country after this great expense may not be disappointed and 
          the rebels encourag'd, but services of this sort go so heavily 
          forward that I can entertain but faint hopes of success. Encloses 
          list of Acts passed etc. Continues : One of the King's ships 
          sent out by Rear Admiral Stewart to cruize upon the Guarda 
          costas has brought in hither two Spanish trading sloops, this 
          has given Mr. Stewart much disquiet having engaged him in a 
          paper squable with the merchants of <placeName ref="#jm_kingston" role="direct">Kingston</placeName>. The young 
          gentleman Crawford who commanded that cruizer stretcht his 
          orders as I realy believe for fear of falling short of them ; however 
          at Mr. Stewart's desire I lay'd the whole affair before H.M. 
          Council here who were unanimous in their opinion that since 
          H.M. had been pleased to approve of his conduct in suspending 
          the execution of his orders relating to reprisals and that he was 
          made to expect speedily further orders in that matter, and that 
          no formal information of captures of English vessels had been 
          given in here since that of Benson's, which indeed was the only 
          one we have had, he should release them ; which I believe he 
          will do speedily. He has sent a particular account to the 
          Admiralty etc. I have not had the honor of any commands or 
          advices from any of the publick offices of later date than the 
          midle of May last. A merchant ship lately arrived on the 
          North side of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this island</placeName> brings news of a general march of the 
          forces towards the coasts in <placeName ref="#english_channel" role="indirect">the Channel</placeName> a general press for 
          manning fifty ships of the line. This may be such ship news 
          as we have been used to, but I must in duty acquaint your 
          Grace that in case of any rupture this island is in a bad state 
          of defence. There has been for many years pass'd great numbers 
          of Irish introduc'd here as servants which constitute the body 
          of our Militia, hired servants of any sort will make but bad 
          soldiers, but those of that nation whose hearts are against us 
          and have neither honor or interest to regard must be reckond 
          as a drawback upon the real strength we may have, as I too 
          well know by experience, and which makes that matter still 
          worse, some of them, lawyers, have got such an ascendant over 
          the thoughtless planters, that they have the chief influence 
          in the election of Assemblymen, and great influence in that 
          House to the obstruction of publick business and all measures 
          for the safety of this island. If your Grace would be pleased 
          to advise H.M. to reject the Act repealing the Protestant act, 
          as 'tis call'd, it may help us in some measure, but his approbation 
          of it will give such matter of triumph to that party that 
          all my endeavours how vigorous soever may be rendr'd of little 
          use to H.M. in the preservation of this island when it may be 
          in danger. On the 19th of August last the gallions twelve in 
          number met with a hurricane in the latitude of <placeName ref="#bm" role="direct">Bermudas</placeName>, four 
          of them put into <placeName ref="#pr" role="direct">Porto Rico</placeName>, two to 
          <placeName ref="#ht_capfrancais" role="direct">Cape François</placeName> all without 
          their masts, the other six we know nothing of hitherto. That storm did not
          reach this island. Signed, Ro. Hunter. Endorsed, R. Jan. 22. 4 3/4 pp. Enclosed,

          Merchants of London to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          In reply to Sept. 1st, enclose following in support of their grievance. 
          Signed, Hum. Morice, Micajah Perry, Rd. Harris and five others. 
          Endorsed, Recd. 23rd Oct., Read 16th Nov., 1731. 1 p. Enclosed,
          434. i. Particular facts and instances in support of the 
          Merchants' petition, (v. 12th Aug. No. 367 i.). (i) Lands 
          and houses are not liable to pay debts in <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> and 
          some other Colonies, though by the laws of <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName> 
          estates in the Plantations are deemed chattel. On a 
          representation of their not being liable to pay debts 
          in Jamaica, H.M. gave instructions to Governor Sir 
          Nicholas Lawes that " whereas it appears that lands 
          are not extendible in Jamaica by the act for establishing 
          courts etc., which is a great prejudice to creditors and 
          discredit to trade ; you are therefore to recommend 
          to the Assembly the passing a law for remedying that 
          inconveniency, or for the more easy recovery of 
          debts." The passing a law to this effect was recommended 
          several times by Sir N. Lawes, to the Assembly, 
          as also by the Duke of Portland in his Government, 
          and by the present Governor etc., but the Assemblies 
          have refused passing any such law etc. Refers to encl. ii. 
          (ii) By an act passed in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName>, 1705, 
          declaring how long judgments, bonds and accounts shall 
          be in force etc., there was a method prescribed for the 
          recovery of debts, but the act having H.M. disapprobation 
          on account of some other clauses, it was 
          expected the method prescribed would have been 
          re-enacted, but the Assembly refused etc. (v. Minutes of 
          Council and Assembly 1730 and encl. iii.) By an act in 
          the volume of laws of Virginia, 1661, the priority of the 
          payment of debts is given to the creditors who are 
          inhabitants of that Province, and by another act, 
          1663, debts owing to persons, non residents were not 
          pleadable, unless for goods imported. By another 
          act, 1661, Virginia owners are exempt from paying 
          the duties of 2s. per hhd., which the merchants of 
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> and other owners of ships are obliged 
          to pay. By another act, 1669, the Virginia owners 
          are also exempt from paying the Castle duty of 1s. 3d. 
          pr. ton which the merchants and others residing in 
          this Kingdom are obliged to pay. By another act, 
          1680, the Virginia owners have the above priviledges 
          confirmed to them. By another act, 1730, for 
          continuing part of an act for laying a duty on liquors 
          etc., there is 3d. per gall, laid on all liquors imported 
          by merchants and others residing in this Kingdom, 
          and but half that duty on persons residing in the said 
          Province, (iii) By an act of <placeName ref="#us_md" role="direct">Maryland</placeName> a duty of 3d. 
          pr. ton is imposed on English ships, from which the 
          ships of the inhabitants are exempted. (Note, now 
          repealed). By another act non-residents are obliged 
          to pay a double duty for furrs exported. Traders 
          from Great Britain were deemed residents. By 
          another a duty of 1s. pr. barrel is laid on pork imported 
          by any but inhabitants in lieu of the duty on furrs, 
          but the English traders' priviledges not preserved. 
          By another a duty of 3d. pr. gall, (which duty if brought 
          by land from <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="indirect">Pensilvania</placeName> is greater) is laid on all 
          liquors ; and also a duty of 20s. pr. head on negroes 
          and Irish servants, neither of which are to be paid, 
          if imported in vessels belonging to inhabitants of the 
          said Province. By another, for the relief of creditors 
          in England against bankrupts who have imported any goods 
          into this Province not accounted for, no creditor of a 
          bankrupt can recover any debt etc. (v. encl. iv.). By an act 
          of Jamaica for repairing the walls of <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName>,
          a duty of 1s. pr. ton is imposed on all shipping. 
          (Note : expired). By another, to oblige the inhabitants 
          to provide themselves with a sufficient number of white 
          people etc., there is 1s. pr. ton laid upon all shipping 
          coming from any place to the Norward, or trading 
          any way to the Southward of the Tropic of Cancer, 
          for the space of one year. By another, for raising 
          several sums etc., there is a duty of 15s. a head laid 
          on the importation of all negroes etc., and 30s. on the 
          exportation of them etc. Quote H.M. Instructions to 
          show that it is his pleasure that no duties should be 
          imposed by Assemblies, whereby the trade and shipping 
          of this Kingdom can be anyways affected. Copy. 2 3/4 pp.</p>

        <p>434. ii. John Tymms, merchant in <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName>, to Humfrey 
          Morice Esq. 13th Sept. 1731. It seems quite 
          counter to the inclinations and intentions of the 
          Assembly to pass a law for the easier recovery of 
          debts, as had been hoped, they having rejected a 
          motion made for that purpose by a considerable 
          majority etc. It is evident we must still labour under 
          the uncertainties and difficulties we have done for 
          many years to our unspeakable loss etc. Insists on 
          the need of a law to extend both real and personal 
          estate etc. As it is, the principal parts of their estates 
          are exempted by law from the payment of debts and 
          negroes are frequently driven away into the woods 
          or mountains out of the Marschall's way. For instance 
          the small benefit accruing from legal processes, the 
          Houses in <placeName ref="#jm_kingston" role="direct">Kingston</placeName> in which I am a partner obtained 
          in one fraud Court 22 judgments, and the Provost 
          Marshall returned to 19 of them nulla bona nee persona 
          et non est inventus. This is an evil which prevents 
          attempts at the better settlement of the island etc. 
          Another evil which is not only mischievous but 
          scandalous, and altho' expedients have been frequently 
          offered by several Governors to remedy it, yet 
          hitherto nothing has been done in it ; which is the 
          uncertain value of the money. It has been raised 
          within my knowledge 25 pr. cent., and until the real 
          value is ascertained, it is impossible to say how much 
          higher it may advance. So long as any person or 
          persons have it in their power to alter the value of 
          our currency, no man can be sure to receive 10s. in

          Governor Hunter to the Council of Trade and Plantations. Transmits by H.M.S. Larke the six acts passed 
          in the last session of Assembly. Continues : Two of them 
          only are of a publick nature, one for continuing the country 
          subsistance, and another for continuing in force a former party 
          act. Encloses Journals and Minutes of Council and of Assembly. 
          Continues : I think none of the acts want any remarks. The 
          private acts the partys concern'd will solicit. For we have 
          now no Agent for <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this Island</placeName>, the Council and Assembly differing 
          as to the nomination and instructions. The two Regiments 
          sent hither are in a deplorable condition of health, one half of 
          the men dead, by dint of rumm, and Officers, the rest very 
          sickly. I hope all is quiet at home, we are but in a poor state 
          for defence here, our Militia consisting chiefly of servants, and 
          these of a sort whose hearts are not with us, consequently their 
          hands of little use for us, whatever they may be of against us.

          Governor Rogers to Mr. Delafaye. Refers to letter 
          of 29th June, " by a vessell sent by Mr. Colebrooke with his 
          appeal to H.M. in Council, from the sentence passed on him 
          here." Has transmitted the trial to his Agents to be laid before 
          H.M. etc., " which I hope will prevent any ill impression being 
          taken to my prejudice, from any complaint of Mr. Colebrooke 
          till my son appears to answer to such, being the bearer of this 
          etc., and now going home on purpose to extricate himself from 
          his unfortunate partnership, and to answer whatever allegations, 
          Mr. Colebrooke may make to justifie his unaccountable 
          behaviour in <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Government</placeName>." Continues : I could wish 
          the most material circumstances of the tryal had been insisted 
          on with less warmth than appears to have been used by the 
          Attorney General, notwithstanding Mr. Colebrooke's aggravations, 
          but as there cannot be expected the same decorum in these as 
          in the Courts of <placeName ref="#europe" role="secondary">Europe</placeName>, I hope these slips will be 
          passed over, and the more essential points regarded ; from 
          which I doubt not it will appear that unless Mr. Colebrooke is 
          restrain'd from his violent attempts to disturb the Government, 
          and influence the ignorant, it will be impossible for any Governr. 
          to doe his duty or support his authority, which I have fully

          Governor Rogers to the Duke of Newcastle. I had 
          the honor to transmit to your Grace the trial of Mr. Colebrooke 
          at large on 2nd Aug. etc. Refers his Grace to his son for further 
          information (cf. No. 436.). Encloses proceedings of Council 
          and Assembly, by which it will appear what obstructions he has 
          met with and what methods have been made use of to prevent 
          the concurrence of the Assembly for the repair of the fortifications, 
          thro' the single influence of Mr. Colebrooke. Continues : 
          Which still continuing over those ignorant people who 
          compos'd the late Assembly, I find myself oblig'd to suspend 
          the convening any other till I have the honor of hearing 
          from your Grace etc. being convinc'd nothing can be done 
          either for H.M. service, or the benefit of this poor Colony, whilst 
          they are amus'd as they have hitherto been. As nothing has 
          yet been done towards the repair of the fortifications, more 
          than my building convenient lodgements for the officers and 
          soldiers, which I found absolutely necessary on my arrival, 
          my son will have the honor to represent to your Grace how much 
          they are in want thereof, and unless I can have the assistance 
          of the inhabitants therein, or some other measures taken to 
          put us in some defencible condition, I greatly apprehend we

          of the Council and Assembly and answers to the Board's 
          Queries, " together with an account of every family on this 
          island " etc. Continues : Having since advis'd with H.M. 
          Council on the most proper methods to encourage inhabitants 
          from other parts to settle on <placeName ref="#is_newprovidence" role="direct">this island</placeName>, it is the unanimous 
          opinion of that Board, that nothing will so much contribute 
          thereto as H.M. goodness in taking the same under his royal 
          protection, frequent contentions having arisen with the agents 
          to the Proprietors of co-partners and the inhabitants concerning 
          the property of the lands, which have greatly discourag'd such 
          as have receiv'd titles from either, and I am much of opinion 
          next to the disputes occasion'd by the abovemention'd Mr. 
          Colebrooke have also impeded the increase of inhabitants in 
          <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Government</placeName>. Repeats part of preceding. Continues : 
          The frequent ill health of most of the soldiers of the Garrison 
          here has render'd it impossible for me to effect anything more 
          than the building a convenient guard room and lodgements 
          for the officers and soldiers which on my arrival I found 
          absolutely necessary, not having as yet had the least assistance 
          from the inhabitants towards the repair of the fortifications, 
          which gives me reason to apprehend that should a war happen 
          before we are in a more defensive condition we shall avoidably 
          become a prey to either the French or Spaniards near us, who, 
          I doubt not are too sensible of the advantage of our scituation

          wants much repair. Heavy guns for a battery under the 
          walls to defend the harbour's mouth will be mounted 
          this winter. A large guard-room was built last year 
          for the officers and soldiers, their shelter having been 
          blown down by a hurricane etc. The Revenue these 
          two years past, though more than it was, has been 
          very inconsiderable, an easy duty being laid on liquors 
          and other imported goods, as well as on vessels built 
          in this Colony. There are not 800 acres of land 
          cultivated on Providence, and great part of that 
          dispersed in patches up and down etc. As the 
          inhabitants will inclose no ground, the cattle do very 
          much damage to the little plantations they have made. 
          In Harbour Island and Islathera there is more land 
          cultivated than on Providence, but as they also plant 
          in patches here and there throughout the islands as 
          they think fit and change them so often 'tis impossible 
          to make a just computation of the whole till they can be brought

          Extract of letter from Major Doyle to Brigadier Jones. There has been a 
          rich Spanish ship lately cast away near <placeName ref="#is_spanishtown" role="direct">Spanish Town</placeName>,
          which I greatly apprehend will give us considerable 
          trouble, if not worse ; It seems the inhabitants of the island, 
          instead of assisting, have plundered the sd. ship and killed 
          several of their men, most barbarously, which has so inraged 
          the Spaniards, that they will not be satisfied, but in the 
          destruction of the whole island. The man of war stationed 
          here, is ordered by the Commander in Chief to go to their 
          assistance, and three days past I received enclosed letter etc. 
          Continues : How it will end, we cannot even guess as yet, 
          but I perceive that the governing part of <placeName ref="#stchristophers" role="direct">this Island</placeName> do not 
          care to be at the expence of putting in provisions for a time, 
          and hazarding their sloop, which if lost would cost them 500£. ; 
          These apprehensions of theirs may possibly save us the trouble 
          of a voyage, which I confess I should not be sorry for, but be 
          it as it may we shall be ready whenever called upon. Copy. 1 p. Enclosed,</p>

          Aug. 6th, 1731. Extract. I saw a letter to the 
          Governour, from the Board of Trade, by which it 
          was recommended to revive the Summons law, I am 
          well assur'd that can't be effected. It was given up 
          by the late President to please the multitude, but in 
          vain, for they insulted him and all the Magistracy the 
          more for it ; having as they judged, got the power 
          into their own hands by that very point. If it is H.M. 
          pleasure (as it is the interest of this Province) to have 
          it revived, I apprehend (as very few if any of the laws 
          of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="direct">this Province</placeName> have been approved or ratifyed at 
          <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">home</placeName>) that his Majesty may declare the repealing act 
          null and void and confirm the Summons law, neither 
          of them having as yet been approved or disapproved 
          by H.M. This would make the merchants and trading 
          part of this Province easy. Signed, Robt. Wright.

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Abstract. Since 
          his letter of 21st Aug., has made a visit to <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> 
          etc.. Encloses what passed at a session of the general Assembly 
          held there. Continues : I am sorry to acquaint your Grace 
          that the long standing dispute between <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts</placeName> and 
          New Hampshire respecting boundaries between them is yet brought
          to no conclusion. But the inhabitants <placeName ref="#rv_merrimack" role="direct">bordering upon the line</placeName>,
          are still expos'd to great inconveniences and hardships, 
          and according to my best observation N. Hampshire is willing 
          in this matter to conform to the Royal Instruction. But I think 
          the Massachusetts are not so frank in the affair, as in reason 
          and justice they ought to be. Nor do I believe this long 
          controversy will ever be adjusted but by directions from H.M. at 
          <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">home</placeName>, and New Hampshire seems to be determined to make 
          their application to the King to give special orders to some 
          Commissioners here to make a settlement of the line, and return 
          it home to H.M. for his approbation. I have nothing material 
          to say to your Grace respecting this Province, only to inclose 
          the Journals of the House of Representatives from the last 
          time I sent them ; I am in daily expectation of H.M. pleasure 
          on what I have so often wrote respecting my support etc. and 
          the supply of the Treasury etc. I am sorry to find myself 
          obliged to trouble your Grace upon a dispute that happened in Augt.
          last with Col. Dunbar about the <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">Fort William and Mary</placeName>
          at New Hampshire on which account I understand he has 
          made a long complaint against me etc. Continues : I had 
          lodg'd orders with the President of H.M. Council at New 
          Hampshire to receive Col. Dunbar when he came with the 
          King's Commission with all proper respect, and for this he 
          thankt me, and notwithstanding his former ill-treatment of 
          me, I was really desirous of living in a good understanding with 
          him, which I thought wou'd most of all constitute to the honour 
          of the King's Government and the peace of his subjects etc. 
          But Col. Dunbar has such a thirst of honour and power beyond 
          his rank, that no gentleman that is his superiour will ever 
          condescend to etc. Continues : When the Capt. of the Fort 
          William and Mary wrote me, " As to the Fort your Excellency 
          has been pleased to favour me with, the Leiut. Govr. says he 
          shall never accept of your Commission for it, for that the says 
          he looks upon with contempt, but swears nobody shall command 
          there, but by a Commission from himself " etc., I then thought 
          it high time to assert the King's honour, and to let the Leiut. 
          Govr. (and all the world) know such insults were intolerable, 
          and certainly such a behaviour cannot be consistent with the 
          duty of a Leiut.-Govr. to his Capt. General and Govr. in Cheif, 
          but must produce anarchy and confusion etc. The Governor 
          has never been esteemed absent from New Hampshire when 
          in the Massachusetts, and the King has settled it with respect 
          to me in his 36th Instruction and in the Leiut. Governor's 
          Commission etc. Continues : I had no controversy with the 
          late Leiut. Govr., nor did he do one thing in the Government 
          without my special leave and direction ; it being but 66 miles 
          from here, and the post passing every week etc. Encloses 
          affidavit by Capt. Walton etc. Continues : " The Leiut. 
          Govr. has not been at New Hampshire for 6 or 7 weeks past, 
          and the Province has been in profound quiet and will continue 
          so, if he keeps out of it. As it is no service to the Crown, nor 
          any benefit to him to be Leiut. Govr., I would beg it of your 
          Grace as a very particular favour that his commission may be 
          superseded, and Col. Sherburne appointed etc. Mr. Westbrook 
          and Mr. Frost have lately desir'd to be dismist from H.M. Council 
          at N. Hampshire etc., and to make up the number of seven 
          according to the King's Instructions, I have appointed 
          Richard Waldron and Benjamin Gambling, gentlemen of

          <placeName ref="#us_nh_newcaste" role="indirect">Newcastle</placeName>. I told him I had one from Governor 
          Belcher. He replied nobody should command there 
          unless under him etc., and as for taking H.E.'s 
          commission for it, he swore he scornd it, defied it and 
          spit at it. On Aug. 14 he came down to the island 
          to take command of the fort as Capt. I told him he 
          might have entrance as Lt. Governor or as a gentleman, 
          but not as Captain of the Fort, or in derogation 
          from my Commission from H.E. etc., and showed him 
          H.E.'s orders to that effect etc. On 20th Aug. I 
          informed him that I had H.E.'s order to permit no 
          vessel to pass the fort but such as brought passes 
          signed by H.E. or the Lt. Gov. wherein he specially 
          mentions, having duly cleared with Richard Wibird, 
          Collector, N.H., upon which he said he would sign no

          the least expectation that the Assembly will ever do anything 
          more (or otherwise). His returning to <placeName ref="#en_lon_whitehall" role="indirect">Whitehall</placeName> could not 
          have been of any service. The bill passed in Oct. last, though 
          not a compliance with H.M. Instructions, was a step further 
          than any Governor has been able to bring the Assembly to ; 
          and that passed in May last was going on in conformity to what 
          they had done in Oct. The Assembly has given him £3,000 
          instead of £1,000 to Governor Shute, and one Address after 
          another have promised to give a constant and ample support 
          to the Governor, so that he believes that they will not recede 
          from that quantum. But he will endeavour to make it more, 
          for £3,500 of the present currency is but £1,000 sterl., and 
          all the perquisites of the Province are not £100 sterl. The 
          annual expence, with the best economy, is more than £3,000, 
          so that it is impossible for a gentlemn. to lay up any fortune 
          by this Government. Hopes by the next shipe to receive H.M. 
          leave to accept what the Assembly last voted him etc. He 
          observes what their Lordships say about the Address from the 
          Representatives. " The method into which I wou'd have 
          steer'd that matter was with an aim at the better support of 
          the honour and prerogative of the Crown, but if your Lordships 
          judge otherwise I am perfectly easy. I have wrote so often 
          to the Secretary of State, and to your Lordships, how opposite 
          this Assembly is to the King's Instruction respecting the supply 
          of the Treasury that I depend your Lordships will transmit 
          me the King's Orders thereon by the first ship, or this Govern- 
          ment will fall into all confusion. For there is now near £20,000 
          due for the support of the King's garrisons and other services, 
          and there has not been a shilling in the Treasury for many 
          months. Nor will the Representatives grant any money unless 
          they can have the supervising and passing every account, which 
          I am fully of opinion is reserved in the Charter to H.M. Governor 
          and the Council, and H.M. 30. Instruction I think exactly agree- 
          able to the royal Charter. " The Assembly have been lately 
          under adjournments waiting for H.M. pleasure on their petitions 
          and addresses" etc. Has lately been to <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> to hold 
          the Assembly. Is sorry the affair of the boundary is not brought 
          to any conclusion, in spite of his pains in both Provinces, and 
          thinks it never will be by them. In justice to New Hampshire, 
          he must say they have been very willing to submit the decision 
          of this affair in exact conformity to H.M. Instruction. But 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts</placeName> have made too many obstacles, nor have they 
          been so candid and fair as N. Hampshire. Has taken all care 
          to keep things and persons from running to the extremity they 
          did in Governor Burnett's time, but is in daily fears of difficulties 
          among the Borderers. It is of absolute necessity for the peace 
          and honour of H.M. Governments and for the welfare of the 
          subjects that this long controversy should be adjusted. N. 
          Hampshire seems resolved to pursue it by an immediate 
          application to H.M. for appointing Commissioners etc. Believes 
          that Assembly would willingly be at the whole charge to have 
          the matter effected. Will order the bills of credit to be called 
          in in accordance to the acts, and will send an account of the 
          paper currency in N.H. Refers to and repeats his account of 
          the Councillors 25th Jan. last. When last there he appointed 
          Benjamin Gambling in the place of Mr. Frost, resigned owing 
          to ill health etc. Is surprised to learn that a gentleman of the 
          Board observed that they would be glad to hear from the 
          new officer the King has appointed under him, before taking 
          any resolution about Councillors. To gratify an inferior 
          Officer by giving him liberty and privilege of nominating the 
          Councillors and of denying it to the King's Governor would 
          subvert all good order, and fill that Government with discord 
          and confusion, " which would be very happy, and so shou'd 
          I, if we might be quit of that uneasy Gentn. Collo. Dunbar, 
          and as his being Lieut. Govr. is no sort of service to him, nor 
          can I (with submission to your Lordships) believe it any to 
          H.M., or that people, I wou'd still pray that Coll. Henry 
          Sherburn might be Leiut. Govr. there " etc. All this part of 
          the world are astonished at the false and malicious account 
          which Col. Dunbar dressed up against him respecting 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's Fort</placeName>. " All I did was conformable to good reason,
          and my duty to the King." Dunbar has continually behaved in an 
          insolent, haughty manner to him. Their Lordships will in a 
          little time be convinced that what he has been so long pothering 
          about in <placeName ref="#us_me_sagadahock" role="direct">the Eastern Country</placeName> will never come to anything 
          under his management " threatening to tye people to trees 
          and whip 'em, and burning the fruits of their honest labour 
          are odd measures to pursue in an English Government, and 
          under the most gracious Sovereign in the world " etc. Set out,

          Rip Van Dam to Mr. Popple. Will communicate

          Council who were of opinion that he must singly make an 
          answer thereto. Continues : " I do not know of any laws 
          made here, or any manufactures set up that may affect the 
          manufactures of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Brittain</placeName>, and as to what relates the

          Lordships will be satisfied that our trade and navigation is not

          Aug. 31st, 1731. Refer to address of Council and Assembly thanking 
          H.M. for appointing as Governor a person so well accomplished 
          and so acceptable to the people. " Notwithstanding 
          which some restless persons for about three weeks 
          past have been endeavouring to disquiet the minds of 
          the weaker sort amongst us, in order to memorial the 
          Governour to the Right Honble. the Lords of Trade 
          and Plantations as a person not a friend to the 
          Province, and to pray that New Hampshire may 
          be no longer under the Governour of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachuset Bay</placeName>
          etc. In duty to our Sovereign, in honour to our 
          Governour in faithfulness to the Province and in 
          justice to ourselves we cannot be dumb on such an 
          occasion but most humbly crave leave to beare 
          testimony against an attempt (tho' never so unlikely 
          to succeed) wch. tends to sap the very foundation 
          of our happiness etc. Praise his " solicitious concern " 
          and unwearied efforts to accomplish the settlement 
          of the divisional line between the two Provinces etc., 
          wch. is what we earnestly supplicate, may have as 
          speedy an issue as is consistent with your Majesty's 
          royal pleasure, for the longer that difference lies open 
          the greater are the mischiefs which attend it etc. 
          Praise the Governor " whose administration is so wise 
          so just so equall and to such universal acceptance " 
          etc. Continue : This your Majesty's Province is so 
          small the people so few, and in general so poor that 
          it makes the settlement of the line still more necessary 
          and is no bad argument to enforce our humble 
          request for being continued under the Governour of 
          the Massachusets Bay, and especially him who at 
          present is, and we hope will long continue, in that 
          station ; for we have done our utmost already even 
          to our almost undoing in fixing so large a summ for 
          the Governor's sallary, pursuant to your Majesty's 
          Instruction, and if more should be required to support 
          the dignity of a resident Governour we can foresee 
          nothing but enevitable ruin, and beside if we should 
          again be visited wth. a French or Indian warr, or 
          both (as at this juncture we are threatned) then yet 
          more deplorable would our condition be, for now we 
          can ask succour (as occasion may require) from the 
          common Father of both Provinces with hopes of 
          success but how it may be upon a different footing 
          God alone knows etc. Pray for H.M. long and glorious reign etc.
