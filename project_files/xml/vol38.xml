        <p>Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Since I 
        had the honour of writing you last I have met the Assembly 
        of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">this Province</placeName> and after recommending to them what I thought 
        needfull for H.M. honour and service, and their own good, and 
        in a more especial manner pressing upon them H.M. 27th 
        Instruction for fixing a salary on me and my successor I waited 
        on them in a session of eighteen dayes, and finding they wou'd         
        come to no amendments on the bill they had past before, I 
        dissolv'd them, and inclose your Grace a Journal of the pro- 
        ceedings at this short session. I have issu'd writts for a new 
        Assembly to meet the 10th of next mo. and hope there will be a 
        change in the Assembly for the better advancing H.M. honour 
        and service, and nothing in my power shall be wanting towards 
        it. But should it be otherwise I think I have done but my 
        duty in dissolving the late Assembly since they would come 
        no nearer to the King's Instruction, etc. Repeats recommendation 
        of Mr. Sherburn for Lt. Gov. of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="descriptive">N.H.</placeName> v. Dec. 15, 1730. On 
        24th Dec. received Additional Instruction of Sept. 26th for the 
        better preservation of H.M. woods and issued Proclamations 
        in both Provinces accordingly. Continues : This day I receiv'd 
        from Col. Dunbar H.M. Order in Council, 12th Nov., mentioning 
        a representation that I was preparing a military expedition 
        against <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's fort</placeName> etc. Continues : In this representation 
        my Lord Duke there is not the shadow of truth, nor did I ever 
        make the least attempt or preparation of that nature. Yet I 
        am not at all surpriz'd that Col. Dunbar had the folly, and 
        confidence as well as malice to make such a representation 
        against me. Because I am lately told he has wrote many other 
        palpable falshoods to do me all the hurt in his power, but if he 
        would confine himself to truth I should not give myself any 
        trouble about him : the ship by which this goes sails in the 
        morning, that I shall not be able to send your Grace the necessary 
        papers of a notorious riott committed by some people belonging 
        to Frederick's fort on some of H.M. subjects of this Province, 
        as also what I directed H.M. Lt. Govr. of this Province to 
        do at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> upon a visitation I order'd him to make to all 
        the fortifications of this Province. Another ship will sail in a 
        few dayes by which I shall send these things for my justification, 
        and which I believe will be to the intire satisfaction of H.M. 
        and his Ministers, and convince your Grace with what injustice 
        this gentleman has treated me. If he intends to take upon 
        him the office of an informer upon all my actions, and then to 
        present them in a false light, it will be giving your Grace and the 
        rest of H.M. Ministers a vast deal of unnecessary trouble. I 
        should be glad when he seeks to make any complaints against 
        me for the future that he would serve me with a copy before 
        he sends them away, then my answer might go in the same 
        ship, and had he done so now, I presume there had been no 
        occasion for H.M. order to me of 12th Nov., the matter on which 
        it is founded being absolutely false. I ask pardon for giving 
        your Grace so great an interruption from the vast affairs of 
        Europe, that ingross your precious hours etc. Signed, J. Belcher.

        <p>Copy of proceedings of the General Court of the 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, Sept., Oct., 1730, relating to a 
          riot at <placeName ref="us_me_newharbor" role="direct">New Harbour</placeName>, near Pemaquid, in York County,
          upon the complaint of Josiah Grover against some 
          Irish settlers, who seized him and his fishing schooner 
          and company when he went to clear and settle some 
          land there purchased by his ancestor, John Brown, 
          from the Indians 15th July, 1625. He escaped to 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName> and complains to the Governor, who instructed 
          the Justices of <placeName ref="#us_me_york" role="indirect">York Town</placeName> to enquire into the matter. 
          Four Irishmen were apprehended at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> by the 
          Sheriff and committed for trial at the next General 
          Sessions. They acknowledged that they assisted in 
          seizing Grover's schooner, and said that they had orders 
          to do so from Alexander Hamilton, Captain of the 
          Fort. When the Sheriff came near Pemaquid, he 
          saw the colours flying at the fort, and being informed 
          by some Irish people that they designed to resist him, 
          he sent a message to the officer there that he came 
          with authority to apprehend some criminals etc. and 
          required his assistance, who answered that he would 
          keep his fort and did not admit the Sheriff etc. The 
          guns were loaded, but the messenger warned the officer 
          that if he went on, they would every one be hanged. 
          Upon which Hamilton said he would take advice with 
          his Council, and went out of the fort, and the Sheriff 
          entered without opposition etc. Copy. 11 pp. </p>
