        Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Since I 
        had the honour of writing you last I have met the Assembly 
        of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">this Province</placeName> and after recommending to them what I thought 
        needfull for H.M. honour and service, and their own good, and 
        in a more especial manner pressing upon them H.M. 27th 
        Instruction for fixing a salary on me and my successor I waited 
        on them in a session of eighteen dayes, and finding they wou'd         
        come to no amendments on the bill they had past before, I 
        dissolv'd them, and inclose your Grace a Journal of the pro- 
        ceedings at this short session. I have issu'd writts for a new 
        Assembly to meet the 10th of next mo. and hope there will be a 
        change in the Assembly for the better advancing H.M. honour 
        and service, and nothing in my power shall be wanting towards 
        it. But should it be otherwise I think I have done but my 
        duty in dissolving the late Assembly since they would come 
        no nearer to the King's Instruction, etc. Repeats recommendation 
        of Mr. Sherburn for Lt. Gov. of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="descriptive">N.H.</placeName> v. Dec. 15, 1730. On 
        24th Dec. received Additional Instruction of Sept. 26th for the 
        better preservation of H.M. woods and issued Proclamations 
        in both Provinces accordingly. Continues : This day I receiv'd 
        from Col. Dunbar H.M. Order in Council, 12th Nov., mentioning 
        a representation that I was preparing a military expedition 
        against <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's fort</placeName> etc. Continues : In this representation 
        my Lord Duke there is not the shadow of truth, nor did I ever 
        make the least attempt or preparation of that nature. Yet I 
        am not at all surpriz'd that Col. Dunbar had the folly, and 
        confidence as well as malice to make such a representation 
        against me. Because I am lately told he has wrote many other 
        palpable falshoods to do me all the hurt in his power, but if he 
        would confine himself to truth I should not give myself any 
        trouble about him : the ship by which this goes sails in the 
        morning, that I shall not be able to send your Grace the necessary 
        papers of a notorious riott committed by some people belonging 
        to Frederick's fort on some of H.M. subjects of this Province, 
        as also what I directed H.M. Lt. Govr. of this Province to 
        do at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> upon a visitation I order'd him to make to all 
        the fortifications of this Province. Another ship will sail in a 
        few dayes by which I shall send these things for my justification, 
        and which I believe will be to the intire satisfaction of H.M. 
        and his Ministers, and convince your Grace with what injustice 
        this gentleman has treated me. If he intends to take upon 
        him the office of an informer upon all my actions, and then to 
        present them in a false light, it will be giving your Grace and the 
        rest of H.M. Ministers a vast deal of unnecessary trouble. I 
        should be glad when he seeks to make any complaints against 
        me for the future that he would serve me with a copy before 
        he sends them away, then my answer might go in the same 
        ship, and had he done so now, I presume there had been no 
        occasion for H.M. order to me of 12th Nov., the matter on which 
        it is founded being absolutely false. I ask pardon for giving 
        your Grace so great an interruption from the vast affairs of 
        Europe, that ingross your precious hours etc. Signed, J. Belcher.

        <p>Copy of proceedings of the General Court of the 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, Sept., Oct., 1730, relating to a 
          riot at <placeName ref="us_me_newharbor" role="direct">New Harbour</placeName>, near Pemaquid, in York County,
          upon the complaint of Josiah Grover against some 
          Irish settlers, who seized him and his fishing schooner 
          and company when he went to clear and settle some 
          land there purchased by his ancestor, John Brown, 
          from the Indians 15th July, 1625. He escaped to 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName> and complains to the Governor, who instructed 
          the Justices of <placeName ref="#us_me_york" role="descriptive">York Town</placeName> to enquire into the matter. 
          Four Irishmen were apprehended at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> by the 
          Sheriff and committed for trial at the next General 
          Sessions. They acknowledged that they assisted in 
          seizing Grover's schooner, and said that they had orders 
          to do so from Alexander Hamilton, Captain of the 
          Fort. When the Sheriff came near Pemaquid, he 
          saw the colours flying at the fort, and being informed 
          by some Irish people that they designed to resist him, 
          he sent a message to the officer there that he came 
          with authority to apprehend some criminals etc. and 
          required his assistance, who answered that he would 
          keep his fort and did not admit the Sheriff etc. The 
          guns were loaded, but the messenger warned the officer 
          that if he went on, they would every one be hanged. 
          Upon which Hamilton said he would take advice with 
          his Council, and went out of the fort, and the Sheriff 
          entered without opposition etc. Copy. 11 pp. </p>

          Col. Dunbar to Mr. Popple. Refers to former letters. 
          Continues : As to my disputes with the New Engld. people 
          I hope I shall be justifyed ; if ever any body was among them 
          without disputes, I will own myself in the fault and submit to 
          be sacrificed to their resentment ; since their Committee was 
          at <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Fredericksfort</placeName> I have been threatened with many actions 
          of trespass, and even high treason for building a fort and hoisting 
          the King's colours, wch. they themselves prostitute at their 
          little pallisadoed truck houses to exchange rum, molasses, and 
          tobacco etc. with the Indians ; I landed here the 10th instant 
          haveing been 12 days in my passage from Fredericksfort ; I 
          was in great danger by islands of ice in the <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="direct">river of Kennebeck</placeName>, 
          but I was obliged to go into that river to stop some saw mills 
          there who were destroying a fine swamp of pine trees near ye 
          water upon lands wch. I have reserved for the Royal Navy in 
          case the Proprietors or claimts. are disallow'd by H.M. etc. I 
          could not avoyd makeing some appointments of lands within 
          10 miles of the fort, where people are clearing ye woods, and 
          converting the timber, wch. is oak, birch, ash, maple and 
          popple, to ship timber, cord wood, and for pottash, and in order 
          to plant corn, garden seeds, hemp and flax in the spring, if I 
          had not done so, of course all would have dispersed, and would 
          never be induced to return, so that <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> would boast 
          of a victory, than which nothing could be a greater mortification 
          to me ; I have not presumed to make any grant, or exercise 
          any sort of jurisdiction, tho' many applications have been 
          frequently made to me in small cases, as a Governour or 
          Majestrate ; I dare not have refused hearing ye partys, then 
          gave my opinion, complaining it was hard upon me, haveing 
          no assistce. to be troubled with little disputes, and desired they 
          might either defer matters or agree among themselves until 
          majestrates could be appointed, and thus I have satisfied the 
          people, and kept them together, but if after all, they must quit 
          and loose their labour, many familys will be undone, and I 
          the unhappy occasion of their misery, as I am at this time of 
          my own ruine and my familys by my zeal and perseverance to 
          promote this settlement, because I am convinced beyond all 
          doubt that it will be very considerable and satisfactory to H.M. ; 
          I send to my Lords Commissioners a smal parcel of hemp and 
          flax, the produce of new ground at Fredericksfort of this year 
          and from New England seed, the seed wch. I had from <placeName ref="#pl_danzig" role="indirect">Dantzick</placeName> 
          by way of <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName>, being treacherously kept concealed until 
          the season was over ; I wish I had a fund to send for some of

          or <placeName ref="#ru" role="indirect">Russia</placeName>.
          I think I could promise to serve <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> with 
          those commoditys in return for their manufacturys without 
          bringing away any of their mony, it is seldome any poor man's 
          scheme is worth anything, however hints may be usefull to 
          great ones ; I ought to be sufficiently discouraged as no notice 
          is ever taken from any of the Offices of my letters, yet I live in 
          hopes, wch. onely supports my spirits. These small samples 
          of hemp and flax, are not in such perfection as they would be 
          had I been at the place in time ; ye person I chiefly depended 
          upon to pull and dress them went away being discouraged by 
          common reports, an Irishwoman pulled, water-rotted and 
          dressed the flax, and the hemp was in the grownd when I arrived 
          there in the end of October, so that it was dew-rotted and even 
          frozen as it stood, the man who dressed it as you see it, has 
          made ropes and geer for cattle and carriages of some of it, and 
          assures me it is very strong, and undertakes to make it of as 
          fine a colour as flax next year, he tells me ye hemp here will 
          be finer than any European and has a good deal of the soft 
          nature of flax etc. From Kennebeck I went to <placeName ref="#us_me_portland" role="direct">Casco</placeName>, where 
          there is onely one loading of masts provideing this year, the 
          rest being contracted for at <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="direct">Piscatua</placeName>, wch. I am glad of in 
          respect to the Province of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> who are generally 
          a loyal good sort of people ; I went to ye undertakers house for 
          ye contract, and shewed him the orders I reed, to prevent 
          logging, he insisted on his right not to be interrupted, and 
          alleddged that he logged on his own private property etc. Refers 
          to enclosed letters which passed between them. Continues : Near 
          his house wch. is built in the woods and upon grownd cleared 
          within three years past, are five new mills each saw can cut 5 
          and sometimes 6000 feet of pine boards in 24 hours, he told me 
          if I sho'd stop his mills it would be ten pounds pr. diem damage ; 
          the lands about Casco are generally called private property, 
          and not one owner of a mill there but was pleased with the easy 
          proposal I made them to prove their property. I hope I am 
          not blameable for this condescention, and besides I am of 
          opinion yt. few or none of them will be deemed good ; some 
          shewed me their titles wch. were patents passed by Sir Edmd. 
          Andros in 1688, wherein are reserves of wheat and mony to 
          the Crown as an annual quit-rent, when I took notice of those 
          reservations, and sayd I would acquaint H.M. therewith, they 
          then disdained those titles, and sayd they did not esteem them, 
          for that they had some old titles from Sir Ferdinando Gorge 
          and Indian deeds ; I asked why they would produce Sir Edmond 
          Andros's pats, to me, they replyed because they seemed best to 
          the eye, but that it was an imposition of his to extort mony 
          from the people. Upon enquiry I find there are very many of 
          those patents, and all register'd, and if no quit-rent has been 
          received since, wch. is payable to H.M. or His Capt. Genll, of 
          the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Masachusets</placeName>, it will amount to a considerable sum, and 
          may easily be recovered after a reform in this Governmt., wch. 
          I hope is now upon the anvil. What I am now speaking of is 
          in the large county of York, formerly called the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">Province of Maine</placeName>,
          90 miles along the sea coast and backwards to ye <placeName ref="#pacific" role="boundary">South Sea</placeName>
          in the original grant ; My Lords Commrs. may think 
          that country is settled and peopled, whereas 20 miles in length 
          and halfe so much in width would be sufficient for them ; there 
          is yet onely one line of towns layd out there and they extend 
          all along the shore and onely eight miles backwards into the 
          country, thus many many millions of acres lye wast, whilst 
          these gentry are opposeing H.M. to make other parts usefull 
          to the Crowne ; if such matters are not represented home, no 
          remedy can ever be applyed ; this country not content with all 
          this ; do claim most part of <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>; it is this stragling 
          manner of settlement has (with their natural ill treatment of 
          all persons) allways exposed them to the insults of the Indians, 
          which (besides many poor souls cutt off), has cost them a great 
          many thousand pounds, and all might have been prevented by 
          gentle usage and some small present yearly to the poor natives, 
          who, unprovoked, seem a good natured people ; I herewith 
          send you a complaint from a Jesuit at one of their tribes 
          settlemt., to whom I wrote in English hearing he was an Irish 
          or Scotchman ; I hope by his influence to secure the friendship 
          of his tribe. Acknowledges receipt of H.M. Additional 
          Instruction for giving his share of the penalties upon loggers 
          to informers. Will endeavour to prevent any abuse of that 
          indulgence etc. Continues : I likewise received (Sunday, 10th 
          Jan.) an office pacquet for Governour Belcher, with which I 
          went to wait upon him, and he being ingaged at dutys (as they 
          call them) I sent it by a gentleman on Monday morning, and 
          wrote to him that some reasons to which he was no stranger 
          prevented my waiting upon him, one of wch. was, the threats 
          of the mobb etc. Encloses his answer, (encl. i). Continues : 
          It is wonderfull how this great man and generally his country- 
          men can act and say, and deny both. His behaviour and useage 
          of me is beyond my imagination, and tho' to my face he denyed 
          many things, I could prove them by many wittnesses, his last 
          stroke is most provokeing of all, he has given out here that I 
          was a spy in <placeName ref ="#es" role="indirect">Spain</placeName> and was so here now upon him and the 
          country. I hope as he is not comeatable here my Lords will 
          think I ought to have some satisfaction for so gross an abuse, 
          one consequence of it had likely to have fallen lately upon 
          Capt. Protheroe, Commander of ye Station ship, who walking 
          in ye street, a man enquired of another who he was, answer 
          was made, Collo. Dunbar, whereupon one replyed God d n 
          him lett us mobb him, but being undeceived, the Capt. escaped ; 
          I came onely hither to attend the Courts upon account of the 
          expences I was unawares drawn into last year at Fredericks-fort,
          and here mett the additional trouble of the return of 500/. 
          sterl. bills drawn by me on my groweing sallary wch. are pro- 
          tested. I intend in a few days to New Hampshire and into the 
          woods, and to send one of my Deputys to remain at Casco. 
          You no doubt have all the proceedings of this Great and General 
          Court transmitted by his Excy. to my Lords, no Governour 
          was ever more hated than he, and notwithstanding any assure- 
          ances he may give to the Ministry of succeeding in getting a 
          fixed sallary from the new Assembly, everybody tells me it 
          never will be given to him, and his pretences are onely to spin 
          out time, and keep the affair out of Parliament. I am even 
          told that the country have soe great an abhorrence of him for 
          betraying them (as they call it) that many of the first rank 
          are upon an Address to H.M. to give them any other Governr. 
          and they will comply with the Instructn. His chief Councilour 
          and favourite is the famous incendiary Dr. Cook, whose character 
          is known at home, and both the Govr. and Doctor irreconcileable 
          enemys to ye Dudley family who are reputed ye chiefs 
          of this country ; they were allways for the sallary and the 
          favourite Cook ever against it, wch. seems unaccountable that 
          a Governour is in earnest, and caresses the man, who is at 
          the head of his opposers. My Lords have heard of Govr. 
          Wentworth's death of New Hampshire, he was a worthy honest 
          gentleman, and is much lamented by the country, it is worth 
          nothing to be Leiut. Governour, who has no sallary but 200£. 
          this country mony, which all chief Governours before Mr. 
          Belcher gave out of their 200£. sterl., and he would not give a 
          shilling, nor is that small province able to give any ; they are 
          apprehensive that Mr. Belcher has recommended one Mr. 
          Waldron to be Lt. Govr., who was Clerk to the Council, 
          and is so now and yet is made a Councillour and a Judge by Mr. 
          Belcher, who has made great changes there, heavy upon gentle- 
          men who were putt in by Mr. Shute and Mr. Burnet for their 
          dutyfull and cheerfull complyance wth. ye Royal instructions. 
          Mr. George Jaffrey is one of them, he is of the Council, was one 
          of the Judges, and Treasurer of the Province, and Vice- judge 
          of the Admiralty, he is a man of good sense, fortune and figure, 
          and much the fittest to command that Province, I believe he 
          would accept of it, tho' I really do not know, but this I am sure 
          that no man there is more disaggreable to the King's friends than 
          Mr. Waldron. I was exceedingly surprised upon my arrival 
          here two days agoe to hear that Govr. Belcher had closetted 
          Mr. Auchmuty the Advocate General and prevailed upon him 
          to give a strange turn and construction to the conference he was 
          wittness to, wch. I gave my Lords an account of by my brother. 
          I taxed the Advocate Genll, with it who swore to me it was 
          false, and that he omitted nothing but the Governour's telling 
          me of sending down 500 men to dismantle the fort and take 
          the people prisoners, he promised to send me a copy of what 
          he gave Mr. Belcher, and to add that circumstance to it, wch. 
          he sayd had escaped his memory, but I rather take it he did it 
          out of complemt. to His Excellency. Mr. Auchmuty has told 
          ye story as I related it to my Lords Commrs., in twenty 
          places in this town etc. Continues : I am informed that many 
          heads here are now at work plodding against me. I defye all 
          the world whilst they stick to truth, but they would do anything 
          to have me removed etc. I am this moment told that there is 
          a Council sitting upon the report of the tryal of the four poor 
          men, brought from near Fredericksfort by order of this General 
          Court fr. the High Sheriffe of the county of York in October 
          last, it is sayd they are convicted but I am not able to learn for 
          what crime etc. I told you formerly they had onely stoped a 
          sloop from taking away some staves cutt by themselves. The 
          Governour wanted to try them for piracy. Pray Sir, Lay this 
          before my Lords etc. Signed, David Dunbar. Endorsed, Recd.

        Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and Plantations. Repeats gists of
        covering letter, Jan. 11th, and refers to those enclosures. Adds : These things, my Lords, 
        are the whole of what I have ever done respecting <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's 
        Fort</placeName> etc., and how was it possible for me to do less ? I inclose 
        your Lordships a memorial I deliver'd into H.M. Secretary of 
        State the 15th May last, in answer to which I should have been 
        very glad of some orders or directions for my conduct, but never 
        receiv'd a word of answer till his Majesty's order in Council of 
        12th Novr. last. According to the clause of the Charter cited 
        in my memorial these lands My Lords are doubtless a part of 
        this Province, and agreeable thereto your Lordships will find 
        in H.M. Commission to me these words, " And the lands lying 
        between the said territory of <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="indirect">Nova Scotia</placeName>, and the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="indirect">Province of 
        Main</placeName>." Quotes Commission to show that it makes the Charter 
        " the great rule of my Government " etc. Continues : How 
        dare I then disobey H.M. or betray the trust he has repos'd 
        in me by refusing a legal protection to his good subjects, when 
        they apply to me. These rioters, My Lords, have been since 
        legally convicted in H.M. Courts, and must doubtless undergo 
        the penalties of the law for such a breach of H.M. peace, and so 
        notorious an assault and riott committed upon the property, 
        and liberty of H.M. good subjects. I am here, my Lords, H.M. 
        Govr. to see a good execution of all his wholsome laws for 
        the safety of his subjects under my care in their lives and 
        estates, and to this end I will endeavour carefully to use the 
        power the King has delegated to me in his Royal Commission 
        etc. Continues : It is false in Col. Dunbar to say, No private 
        persons have hitherto set up any claim on those lands, because 
        there have been a great many claims made, and are made daily, 
        and the people that claim think they have a just right (tho' 
        not by any grant of this Province) and one of the men whom 
        Coll. Dunbar's people riotted and assaulted has a claim there 
        descended down to him for 105 years past as may be seen in 
        his complaint against these notorious riotters. My Lords, 
        every man's private property is his life, and I can't answer for 
        people's giving away what they think their own. But for the 
        right of this government to those lands according to the Royal 
        Charter. Had Coll. Dunbar wisely manag'd about 'em I think 
        I should have had influence enough with this Assembly to have 
        made a cession of their right to the Crown : and it was always 
        my opinion that it wou'd be greatly to the advantage of this 
        Province, that the Crown should settle those lands. Yet etc. 
        I know not how to answer those that say, The Crown has always 
        supposed these lands to be a part of this Province, or why have 
        the Govrs. of the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="indirect">Massachussetts</placeName> been ordered from time 
        to time to insist with the Assemblies to rebuild the Fort at 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName>. They say why have not the Governours of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">New 
        Hampshire</placeName> and Nova Scotia had those Instructions, and again 
        the King has directed the choice of a Councellour in the Royal 
        Charter to be chosen on account of those lands, and who of 
        course becomes one of the Legislators of H.M. Province of the 
        Massachusetts Bay, and without such a Councellour the present 
        Constitution cannot subsist. My Lords, I should be glad, I 
        say, to be instructed how to answer these things etc. Concludes : 
        I am tired of writing as I fear your Lordships will be of 
        reading, yet I must not be so vilely traduc'd and not answer 
        for myself ; I am an honest man, and hope ever to appear so. 
        Nor cou'd I possibly have done more from my arrival to this 
        day, than I have, in support of H.M. Dominions as well as for the 
        welfare of the Provinces under my care etc. Signed, J. Belcher.

        The rebel negroes would then have to surrender, and, 
        amounting to 10,000 could be sold at 201. a head to 
        pay expences and for maintaining forts etc. The 
        mountainous woods at present occupied by the negroes 
        or unoccupied would then supply abundance of game 
        and provisions. Also it is well known there have been 
        veins of gold and silver ore found in the blew moun- 
        tains, which the dread of the negroes alone prevents

        <p>Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. Refers 
          to letter of 11th Jan. Continues : My worthy friend and 
          agent Mr. John Caswall will deliver this into your Grace's hands, 
          to whom I have sent all the papers referr'd to in my last to be 
          deliver'd to your Grace, wheh you'll please to order him to 
          attend you with them etc. (v 11th Jan.). Continues : These 
          things are the whole of what I have ever done respecting 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's Fort</placeName>etc. Continues : 
          You'll find among these papers the copy of a memorial I made to the King and deliver'd 
          into your Grace's hands when I had the honour to take leave 
          of your Grace at <placeName ref="en_lon_newcastle" role="secondary">Newcastle House</placeName>, 15 May last, to which I should 
          have been glad of an answer. But never reciev'd one word 
          till H.M. order of 12th Nov. last came to my hands. In that 
          Memorial your Grace will find cited a clause of the Royal Charter 
          of this Province, making the lands at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> a part of this 
          Province, and agreeable thereto they are contain'd in H.M. 
          royal commission to me for this Government. Quotes from 
          Commission directing him to act according to the Charter. 
          Continues : How dare I then disobey H.M. etc. by refusing a 
          legal protection to his good subjects when they apply to me for 
          it. These riotters have been since legally convicted in H.M. 
          Courts, and must doubtless undergo the penalties of the law 
          for the breach of H.M. peace, and so notorious an assault and 
          riott etc. As H.M. Governor he will see a good execution of 
          his laws etc. Continues : Nothing can appear more false than 
          Collo. Dunbar's saying I was preparing a military expedition 
          against Frederick's Fort etc., nor did anything like it ever enter 
          into my thoughts. It is also false in him to say no private 
          persons have hitherto set up any claim to those lands, because 
          there have been a great many claims made and are made daily, 
          and the people that claim think they have a just right (tho' 
          not by any grant of this Province) and one of the men whom 
          Collo. Dunbar's people riotted and assaulted has a claim there 
          descended down to him for 105 years etc. v. 11th Jan. [encl. i]. 
          Continues : Every man's property is his life, and I can't answer 
          for people's giving away what they think their own, but for the 
          right of this Government to those lands according to the Royal 
          Charter. Had Collo. Dunbar wisely manag'd about them I 
          think I should have had influence enough with this Assembly 
          to have made a cession of their right to the Crown, and it was 
          always my opinion that it would be greatly to the advantage 
          of this Province, that the Crown should settle those lands. Yet 
          etc., I know not how to answer those that say, the Crown has 
          always supposed those lands to be a part of this Province, or 
          why have the Governours of the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts</placeName> been ordered 
          from time to time to insist with the Assemblies to rebuild the 
          fort at Pemaquid, they say, why have not the Governours of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">New Hampshire</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="indirect">Nova Scotia</placeName> had those Instructions, and 
          again the King has directed the choice of a Councellour in the 
          Royal Charter to be chosen, on account of those lands, and who 
          of course becomes one of the legislators of H.M. Province of the 
          Massachusetts Bay, and without such a Councellour the present 
          Constitution cannot subsist. My Lord Duke, I should be glad 
          I say to be instructed how to answer these things. But that 
          Gentleman has made himself so obnoxious to this countrey in 
          general, that I can attempt nothing with hopes of success, 
          where he has any concern. I humbly beg of your Grace, that 
          at no time any complaint may take effect to my prejudice till 
          I have time to make answer thereto for as it is the undoubted 
          right of the meanest Englishman to be heard upon any accusa- 
          tion, much more must it be the right of the King's Govr. whom 
          H.M. in his royal Instructions is pleas'd to call the representative 
          of his own person here. And I think Collo. Dunbar ought to 
          observe a decency to a Gentleman who has the honour to bear 
          so great a Commission from the King, yet I shall in my next 
          show to your Grace how rude he has been on this head. I 
          believe a short time will discover how little prudence he has, 
          and consequently of how little service he can be to the Crown, 
          in bringing forward the designed settlements. I hope always 
          My Lord Duke, to maintain the character of an honest man, 
          and I must assure your Grace it has been impossible for me to 
          do more from my arrival to this day, than I have in support of 
          H.M. honour and dignity, and for the interest of his British 
          Dominions, as well as for the Provinces under my care etc.

          Governor Worsley to the Council of Plantations.
          Encloses following : Is not able to send the Treasurer's account 
          of the 2s. Qd. levy of 1730, he not having made up his account 
          which does not end till the 19th instant. Continues : Your 
          Lordships will observe in my Speech to the Council and Assembly 
          I gave them a hint of finding some expedient at this present 
          juncture in relation to the payment of the arrears due to H.M. 
          upon the 2s. Qd. levy, what I have mentioned to some particular 
          Gentlemen is that they would pass a bill in the preamble of 
          which they might make their submission to H.M. on account 
          of their past faults, and to oblige those persons to pay their 
          levy for the two last years who have not done it, and to have 
          prayed H.M. to remit the fines and forfeitures that have been 
          incurred. Tho I could not nor did not propose to pass such a 
          bill yet I could have transmitted it home for H.M. most gracious 
          commands thereon, and if H.M. would have been pleased to 
          have remitted the fines and forfeitures and to have allowed me 
          to pass it, I believe it would have made the whole island easy 
          tho' most of the Assembly as I am told are convinced that what 
          they have done is erroneous yet dare not make use of this 
          expedient for fear of the people, who would then see they have 
          been deluded ; unless they were ordered so to do, however they 
          are so unaccountable in their conduct that I can be certain of

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. As I have allways endeavour'd 
          to protect and countenance H.M. Patent Officers and their Deputies 
          in <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">this Island</placeName>, I am sorry I 
          should have any occasion of complaining to your Grace against 
          any one of them especially Messrs. Reynolds the Provost 
          Marshall whose Patent three years ago was struck at by the 
          complaints that were made to me against their Deputy by the 
          same party, that they are now endeavouring to serve, and had 
          I not then conducted it, as I did, perhaps it would not have been 
          in the Patentees power now to have acted as they of late have 
          by putting in such Deputys, as I apprehend cannot be for H.M. 
          service, in that they have been supported, and recommended 
          to them by those, who have opposed the payment of H.M. tax 
          here, and have said, as I am informed, they would have officers 
          of their own. Refers to enclosures. Continues : I find Capt. 
          Kennedy has discover'd in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, what I have a long time 
          suspected here ; the persons they have deputed, are Mr. George 
          Gascoigne and upon his death, or absence or disability of acting 
          Mr. Thomas Granger, who is at present Deputy Clerk of the 
          General Assembly, and therefore a most improper person for 
          that office. Mr. Gascoigne did not pay H.M. tax the year before 
          the last, as your Grace will see by authentick copys of the 
          Treasurer's account, enclosed, and the last year he did not give 
          in number of his negroes etc. Their design is to get all the 
          Deputy's to the Patent Officers, and I am told are now endeav- 
          ouring to prevail with Mr. Whitworth to appoint a Deputy 
          Secretary in the room of Mr. Webster. Upon the perusal of the 
          above-mentioned letters, your Grace will observe the artifices 
          that are made use of to make me uneasy in my Government. 
          Mr. Ashley's mandamus not being come according to his 
          expectation, and as he gave out it would, has much disappointed 
          the party who opposed the payment of H.M. tax, and I can't 
          help mentioning to your Grace that several Gentlemen upon 
          that occasion have said, that if mandamus's come to those who 
          oppose the paying H.M. tax, what must we do then. With 
          this your Grace will receive a list of those persons names, who 
          ought to have paid the 2s. Qd. levy the year 1729 but did not, 
          as also the late Treasurer's account for the said levy for the 
          same year, in which are particularly mentioned the names of 
          those persons of every parish, who did pay etc. Continues : 
          Whether Mr. Ashley has paid since, I cannot tell, in that the 
          present Treasurer has not made up the last year's account, but 
          if he has it is probably to avoid paying the penalty, because 
          Mr. Cornor one of the then Assembly-men for <placeName ref="#bb_stphilip" role="direct">St. Phillips parish</placeName>
          had returned him as a defaulter. H.M. Council here having 
          rejected the Assembly's bill appointing Messrs. Forster, and 
          Leheup their Agents, the Gentlemen of the Assembly and others 
          have agreed as I am informed to fix them their Agents, and by 
          voluntary contribution have raised the same sallary, as was 
          appointed by the said bill, and Mr. Peers their Speaker to 
          correspond with them and have left it to Mr. Leheup, that

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. Since
          the sealing of a letter to your Grace this morning, I have received 
          an authentick copy of the Minutes of Assembly of yesterday, 
          tho' I must observe there was but twelve of the twenty-two 
          members present. What is mentioned in their second motion, 
          is in relation to a late election for a vestry for <placeName ref="#bb_stphilip" role="direct">St. Phillips parish</placeName>, 
          betwixt Mr. Weeks one of H.M. Council here, and Mr. Ashley 
          etc. (v. encl. i). Continues : The law of elections for Assembly- 
          men, and Vestrymen obliges all the voters to take the oaths 
          appointed to be taken instead of the oaths of Allegiance and 
          Supremacy. Mr. Ashley and Mr. Culpeper brought one 
          Coupman a Roman Catholick to vote, Mr. Weekes insisted upon 
          his taking all the present State oaths, Mr. Ashley affirmed that 
          by the law of elections he was obliged to take the oaths appointed 
          to be taken instead of the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy. 
          Mr. Weekes refused the said Coupman to vote, and Mr. Culpeper 
          another of the candidates of the same side with Mr. Ashley has 
          prefered a petition etc. (encl. i), which is to be heard in Council. 
          This law of election was made in Mr. Cox's presidentship, and 
          if the oaths, the voters are to take, do not extend to the 
          abjuration, and the test, the said oaths were appointed to let 
          in Roman Catholicks, and others to vote at the said elections. 
          The affidavit I have inclosed etc., will set this matter in its 
          true light etc. Signed, Henry Worsley. 3 pp. Enclosed,</p>

          Whilst he was at <placeName ref="#us_me_falmouth" role="direct">Falmouth</placeName> [[ed - CSPC errantly locates Falmouth in NH]],

        <p>Winchelsea In <placeName ref="#en_thedowns" role="from">the Downs</placeName>.
          Capt. Waterhous to Mr. Popple. Encloses following answers.
          Continues : The Fishery at <placeName ref="#ca_ns_canso" role="direct">Canço</placeName> is manag'd after 
          a manner different from that practis'd in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName>;
          for, instead of boat-fishing, it's wholly carry'd on by imbarkations. 
          call'd scooners, who are on the banks, sometimes a fortnight, 
          more or less as winds and weather present, so that it's impossible 
          the fish can prove so good as those brought in every day, which 
          is done by boat fishing ; but that can't be expected till the 
          place is settled with proper inhabitants, that can tarry there 
          winter and summer, which at present, is otherwise, the <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> 
          people having most of the property : They come in the 
          spring, and about the beginning of September return to New 
          England again, leaving two or three hands in each property 
          till next spring to provide for the flake, which are in very good 
          order etc. The place is extensive and full of islands, which are 
          very commodious for the Fishery, but there are wanting fortifi- 
          cations to secure even those that are now on that employment, 
          in case of a rupture with the Indians, or, our neighbours, the

        <p>Answers to preceding by Capt. Waterhous. 22nd
          Jan., 1730/1. (i, ii) The inhabitants are possess'd of 
          no stages, cook-rooms, or train-fats, their business 
          being wholly employed in curing fish, very little oil is made at
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns_canso" role="direct">Canço</placeName>. (iii) No aliens or strangers do 
          resort to <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>, or islands adjacent thereto to 
          take bait, trade, or fish on any account whatsoever in 
          those parts, (iv) The fishermen are wholy supplyed 
          from <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> with the manufactures of the 
          Kingdom, either by British ships trading to Canço 
          etc. or from <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName>. I cannot find that they 
          are supply 'd with anything from foreign countries, 
          except what the New-England-men bring for their 
          own subsistence, (v, vi) The wages for carrying on 
          the fishery at Canço alters, some going by shares, and 
          others by the season, but mostly by what they catch, 
          so that the industrious man gets most : they are 
          commonly paid by bill ; or take up necessaries they 
          have an immediate occasion for ; but the charge of 
          fitting out and maintaining a scooner is uncertain, the 
          men having half they catch, and the owner, who finds 
          ware, tare, salt and provisions, has the other half, 
          (vii) The fishermen have no employment for their 
          people, but wholly to catch fish, the shoremen curing 
          them. The fishing scooners commonly carry five men 
          each ; the fish they afford at a settled price, viz. this 
          year at 40s. p. quintal New England money. I must 
          observe to you, that no topmast vessel does catch fish 
          in those parts, for its morally impossible any vessels 
          but scooners can do on this coast. There was not one 
          top-mast vessel there this year, (viii) By the latter end 
          of September all the fishermen go to New England in 
          their scooners (perhaps two or three men left to look after 
          their houses and flakes), to provide for the next season, 
          (ix, x) No houses of the inhabitants interfere with the 
          Fishery, but all contiguous to themselves, their flakes 
          as nigh the water-side as possible, and so run up in 
          the country as far as they have hands to manage 
          them ; the length uncertain ; just as the nature of 
          the ground will allow ; every man being allotted his 
          proportion of ground pr. Governor Philips. Their 
          flakes are in very good order and room enough, (xi) 
          The British ships that come from <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> for a sack 
          at Canço are victuald from Britain, and some bring 
          provisions to sell to the fishermen, (xii) There is 
          no such thing as ships making their own cargoes of 
          fish, (xiii) Taverns or publick-houses in Canço about 
          11, which are contiguous to the garrison for the benefit 
          of the soldiers, (xiv) As to their remaining as servants 
          to the inhabitants, there is no such thing ; for the 
          Proprietors and scooners with their crews go home 
          about Sept. etc. v. Art. viii. (xv-xvii) No servants 
          are brought from England as is practis'd in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName>.
          As for thefts and disorders there are very few, 
          at least when I was there, considering 130 scooners, 
          whose crews make up 650 men. Some debauch'd 
          people must be expected among such a number. The 
          people left behind last year were about 50 exclusive 
          of garrison, and about the same this year, (xviii) The 
          New England men do steal away some of the seamen, 
          but when detected severely suffer for it ; but they 
          are now more cautious, because I made an order, and 
          declar'd I would make reprisals, which I did on one of 
          them, when one of our men deserted, (xix) I can 
          answer for this year, what fish has been ship'd will 
          turn out well (if they have not a bad passage), con- 
          sidering the bad season, not having a fish day above 
          once in three weeks, that is, a day for hardning the 
          fish for shipping. As for their taking care in well 
          curing the fish, there is no industry wanting when 
          opportunities offer ; for their whole dependance is 
          upon their goodness ; and it's my opinion the masters 
          are more in fault than the shore-men to take fish, when 
          they know they are not thoroughly cured, (but I have 
          endeavour'd to put things to rights this year) which, 
          in some measure, may have been the occasion of 
          former complaints from the merchants. I have made 
          an enquiry of the manner of curing the fish, which is 
          as follows, vizt., they allow 10 hogsheads of salt to 
          100 quintals of fish, which I think very sufficient ; for 
          if they allow more in the hot season they would be 
          salt-burn'd, which is a great loss : and as to fish caught 
          in the spring, they cannot be much prejudic'd, except 
          in colour, which can't be so bright as the Newfound- 
          land fish that are caught in boats ; for the scooners 
          are commonly out a fortnight or ten days, according 
          as winds and weather present : but in hot weather they 
          run hazard ; for then some fish will be salt-burn'd 
          when they are brought on shore ; and there is no help 
          for it, tho' it is the occasion of some turning out 
          refuge fish, which is a great loss to them. The whole 
          fishery is carry'd on by the New England people in 
          embarkations, call'd scooners, which are the only 
          vessels to fish on this coast, and indeed it's the only 
          way at present they not employing any boats, tho' 
          its an excellent place for boat-fishing ; but that can't 
          be expected till settlements are fix'd by people that 
          can remain there summer and winter, which, for want 
          of proper fortifications, is at present neglected, their 
          properties not being secured to them, (especially on 
          the main) in case of the Indians breaking with us, 
          which at present we are under no apprehensions of, 
          tho' they are a sullen and treacherous people and it's 
          possible, on their breaking, they may destroy the whole 
          Fishery. The garrison being pin'd up to defend them- 
          selves, the Indians may come with numbers of canoes 
          to the back of the Fishery, and do the mischief, not- 
          withstanding the garrison, by reason the garrison 
          must have boats to transport them from one island to 
          the other ; and their way of attacking is commonly

          years they have 70 sail. I can't find any Irish Papists 
          settled among the French, at least I have not heard 
          of any, they never appearing nigh our port, and 
          whenever I meet any of their boats, nigh Can9o, they 
          presently go off. (xxi) I can't find any of the officers

          of themselves or others, in the Fishery, but the whole 
          carried on by the Proprietors, who have houses and

          Governor Hunter to the Duke of Newcastle. Venture 
          this by a Bristol ship which is to sail tomorrow morning and 
          it serves only to acquaint your Grace of the safe arrival of the 
          Enterprize Capt. Smith on the 18th of this month by whom I 
          had the honour of two of your Grace's letters of the 9th of Nov., 
          1730. On the 26th of last month the Adventure Lord Muskery 
          Capt. sailed from <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName> bound for 
          <placeName ref="#cu_havana" role="direct">Havana</placeName> where he is to 
          take on board that part of the treasure of the Genoesa which the 
          Spanish Capt. en second De la Hay now in prison at Havana had 
          carried off with him (in a sloop belonging to <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this island</placeName> which 
          was sent him to save the crew) and then to proceed for <placeName ref="#es_cadiz" role="indirect">Cadiz</placeName>; 
          but of this Rear Admiral Stewart by who's orders his Lordship 
          acts will give your Grace a more particular account. Encloses 
          account of the treasure (No. i) etc., " which I had this morning 
          from Mr. Stewart." Continues : On the first advice I reced. 
          of H.M. orders to send two regiments forthwith from <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">Gibraltar</placeName>
          for the defence of this his Island, which indeed wanted it much, 
          I by proclamation call'd the General Assembly to meet on the 
          21st of this month, being prorogued to a longer time. They 
          met, but not in a number to proceed to business, desired leave 
          to adjourn to Monday the 26th instant, which was granted them ; 
          I wish and am not without hopes that they may make suitable 
          returns for H.M. care of their safety at a time when it is apparent 
          that they are in no condition to take care of themselves. All 
          who have anything here to care for and no views of bettering 
          their fortunes by changes rejoyce with hearts full of gratitude 
          for this timely succour and protection when they least expected 
          it. Mr. Stewart sends the Tartar to cruize to the windward 
          with my orders to the Officer commanding the troops on board 
          the transports which will be in conformity with the advice of 
          Council (end. ii). I hope they bring tents with them ; I have 
          however sent orders to <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, to make preparation for 
          their reception by repairing the old and building new hutts and 
          barracks. A small party sent out from the leeward brought 
          in a negro woman prisoner who has informed as in the paper. 
          (No. iii). There can remain no doubt of their correspondence 
          with and encouragement from the Spaniards. And I am affraid 
          they have the same with and from some within. The paper 
          mark'd (No. iv) is the copy of a letter from Lehy at <placeName ref="#ie_dublin" role="direct">Dublin</placeName>
          brought to my hands by our Attorney General, having by 
          mistake been delivered to the Executor of Mr. Murray deceas'd 
          by reason of the resemblance of the names Morrogh and Murray. 
          The original I shall send by Capt. Smith, that your Grace, if 
          yo(u) think fitt, may be better inabled to inquire after and find 
          out the writer. Last Monday one Tuder who has the command 
          of the party now fitting out against the slaves in rebellion on 
          the North East of this island, and the fittest man for that 
          command, having behaved himself well on that service when 
          others fail'd, was arrested at <placeName ref="#jm_kingston" role="direct">Kingston</placeName> where his party were 
          rendezvous'd for a petty debt contrary to law being a freeholder, 
          and kill'd in the Marshall's house by a shott behind him, two 
          of his party kill'd and some wounded at the door by the 
          Marshall's men, who are all here now in goal, the Coroner's 
          inquest having found the fact willfull murder. Of this I shall 
          be more particular by Capt. Smith. No. v is a copy of the last 
          letter I reced. from the General of the gallions etc. I have 
          desired Mr. Stewart to keep the Enterprize here a few days that 
          I may be able by her to inform your Grace what measures 
          the Assembly shall enter or resolve upon for the accommodating 
          and providing for the two regiments etc. Signed, Ro. Hunter.

          Governor Hunter to Mr. Popple. On the 16th of this 
          month I received by the Hannibal their Lordships' letter of 
          Oct. 22nd. Tho' I gave my assent to an act repealing the 
          Protestant act, chiefly because of the objection against it at 
          that board ; yet I believe every friend to the King's Government 
          in <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this Island</placeName> are sensible of the obligations they ly under to 
          their Lordships' for recommending the first to his Royal appro- 
          bation. Their danger from Irish Papist avow'd or conceal'd 
          having been greater than they apprehended so, much need not 
          be said to perswade their Lordships to get this repealer dis- 
          approv'd. They may perhaps amend it by a subsequent. The 
          very Faction itself would be ashamed on this side to say that 
          I had or possibly could have any views of putting my son's 
          names in patents for land at <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="indirect">Port Antonio</placeName>, but that of 
          encouraging others to become settlers, and if I could have don 
          it without discouraging such, I would have long ago removed 
          the negros I have there, which I leave a sacrifice to that view, 
          and have offered these or any other lands thereabouts in my 
          power or the King's grant to any person who will settle there 
          with the same number of negros, and these lotts are in partner- 
          ship with Col. Nedham the best settler of new ground here, 
          and he well knows the truth of what I say. I am surpris'd 
          at what their Lordships write about the old Seal, it was seal'd 
          up in Council, put into a box together with the Acts of Assembly 
          etc. and sent on board of the Plymouth, Capt. Bridge, 10th May 
          last by one of the Marshals, who brought a receipt for the 
          same, but I can not account for or guess at the cause of the 
          miscarriage. I hope before this time it may be found out. 
          This goes by a British ship which sails to-morrow morning, so 
          that I have not time to write as I ought to their Lordships, 
          but by Capt. Smith of the Enterprise which will sail in a few 
          days and is kept here on purpose their Lordships will hear from 
          me directly, in the mean time you may communicate what you 
          please of this. Signed, Ro. Hunter. Endorsed, Recd. 19th

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. When I was last

          House at <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">Portsmouth</placeName> the capital of the Province. H.M. Council

          to defray the charge of these things, and at the same time to 
          postpone the payment of 150,000£. and 1730£. now out on a 
          loan ; to this bill I could not give my consent, because I suppos'd 
          it to interfere with H.M. 22nd and 23rd Instructions to me : 
          But I promis'd to send the bill to your Grace, and to humbly 
          crave in their behalf, that your Grace would procure and send 
          me H.M. royal leave to give my consent to the bill, which is 
          inclosed. I am with great submission to your Grace of opinion, 
          that the bill can be of no prejudice but will greatly advance

          Mr. Popple to Wm. Coleman. I have laid your letter 
          of this day's date before my Lords Commissrs. etc., and am
          commanded to acquaint you for the information of the gentlemen who desire
          the Chancery Act of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> should be confirm'd, 
          that their Lordps. have frequently had the same under their
          consideration, but do not apprehend they can be justified in
          advising H.M. to confirm it, because they have several objections
          to it, and tho' it be not usual in matters of so public a nature,
          for their Lordships to declare either their opinion or their 
          reasons for their opinion, to any person whatever, before they 
          shall have laid the same before H.M. ; Yet their Lordps. have 
          been pleased to command me to acquaint you, that they appre- 
          hend the principal grievances complain'd of and intended to be 
          remedied by this act, may be effectually redress'd by H.M. 
          Instructions to His Govr. of the <placeName ref="#leeward" role="indirect">Leeward Islands</placeName>;
          and if any inconvenience should arise from the execution of those 
          Instructions, they may from time to time be alter'd and amended 
          as the benefit of the subject may require ; but it would not be 
          so easy to redress any evil arising from the effects of an act once 
          become absolute by the Royal approbation. That there is a 
          very extraordinary clause contained in this act, whereby it is 
          attempted to exclude the jurisdiction of all the Courts of

        <p>Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. Quote 
          from Governor Philipps' and Col. Dunbar's Instructions as to 
          laying out lands. Continue : But they having represented 
          to us, that, if they are obliged to follow the letter of these 
          Instructions, it would be a great discouragement to the settle- 
          ment of the Province, inasmuch as the finding out of proper 
          tracts of wood lands for the service of the Royal Navy would 
          require much time and consequently delay, if not disappoint, 
          the intention of such persons as may be at present disposed to 
          settle in <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>, more particularly great numbers of 
          Palatines and Irish Protestants, who are now willing and 
          desirous to become planters there ; we take leave humbly to 
          propose to your Majesty, in order to remove this obstacle, that 
          Colo. Dunbar may be impower'd, notwithstanding the said 
          Instructions, so soon as he shall have mark'd out any quantity
          of woodlands for the service of your Majesty's Royal Navy, 
          to set out an equal quantity of land not fit for that service 
          for such persons as shall be disposed to settle etc., always taking 
          care, that the lands, for the use of the Royal Navy, be first 
          mark'd out, and that those intended for private settlements 
          be on such lands only as are not fit for the service aforesaid ; 
          by which means the service of the Royal Navy will be 
          effectually provided for, and the settlement of this Province 
          may at the same time go forward etc. Propose to prepare 
          Instructions to them accordingly. [C.O. 218, 2. pp. 224-226.]</p>

          the present Surveyor Genl. of ye Woods, to 
          succeed him, thro' your Grace's protection and favour. And
          we do this purely out of regard to H.M. service, because we
          apprehend this would encrease Mr. Dunbar's authority in
          those parts and greatly contribute to ye preservation of H.M. Woods.

          Lewis Bonnet to Mr. Delafaye. Warns him against 
          Mr. White, who has joined with Mr. Colebrooke to embarrass 
          the Governor for their own ends. Continues : Mr. Colebrooke 
          was chosen Speaker of the Assembly in which were several of 
          his creatures, so that by his artifice, and the ignorance of the 
          majority of the members, he carryed everything as he pleased, 
          and Mr. White being a great talker in the Council, most of 
          which were the old inhabitants and illeterate, they two consulted 
          their measures with the Assembly so as to be continually 
          pushing forward their own views, by which means they soon 
          began to lord it over the people in a very haughty and imperious 
          manner and to oppose the Governor in everything they could, 
          espetially in his designs of repairing the fortifications etc. 
          Mr. Colebrooke by his logick and sophistry, which the people 
          were very much unused to, prevented their coming to any 
          resolution about it, and Mr. White exerted himself to the same 
          purpose in the Council, which appearing very plain to the 
          Governor upon receiving a very extraordinary message from 
          the Assembly, he desired Mr. White and one Mr. Jenner another 
          tool of Mr. Colebrooke's to retire from the Council Board 
          into another room whilst he would acquaint the other 
          Gentlemen with something which he would not have them 
          enter into till it came to be debated in Council, they accordingly 
          withdrew and the Governor in a very little time sent for them 
          to take their seats, to enter on business, but Mr. White was 
          gone and hastened to acquaint the Speaker, Mr. Colebrooke 
          with this affair, and Mr. Jenner denyed to go in, saying Mr. 
          White was gone and he would go to etc. ut supra. Continues : 
          Upon this Mr. Colebrooke took upon him to harangue the 
          Members of the Assembly in a very extraordinary and seditious 
          manner, told them they were threatened with arbitrary power, 
          and bid them joyn with him and he would make an humble 
          address to H.M. that he would please to send them an honest 
          Governor who would act by law, and recall his tyrannical 
          and arbitrary Governor home, and amused the people with 
          speeches to this effect, and prevented their proceeding to do any 
          business till he had quite tired their patience, and the Governor 
          found it necessary to disolve them to lett the poor people go 
          about their private affairs since it was evident their Speaker 
          would divert them from doing the publick any service. As 
          soon as the Assembly was disolved, Mr. Colebrooke seized 
          upon all the books and papers thereof, and would not deliver 
          them to the Clerk, and afterwards denyed them to the Governor 
          in Council, who required them in order to send fair transcripts 
          home etc. Then Mr. Colebrooke applied himself to make a 
          party in the following Assembly, now sitting, and joyn'd himself 
          with the most ignorent of them in order to have a majority of 
          voices, and became reconciled to a man of whom he always 
          spoke with the utmost contempt, and who always represented 
          Mr. Colebrooke as one of the vilest of men, and the most 
          obnoxious to any civil Government, yett by giving him and 
          others large credit (out of the effects of some gentlemen at 
          home who intrusted him) and promises of more, he has got 
          them over to his side, and now he goes on very strenuously in 
          his old strain of opposing the fortifications being repaired, and 
          said publickly in the house at the first meeting of the present 
          Sessions that he always detested and abhorred the garrison etc. 
          Continues : The great opinion I have of the Governor's honour, and his constant endeavours 
          to promote the welfare of <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Colony</placeName>,
          and the very bad usage he has received from these two 
          persons who were both so much obliged to him, and Mr. White 
          being returning home on purpose to do him all the prejudice 
          he can, extorted this epistle from me etc. Signed, Lews.

          Governor Rogers to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. On the 11th Oct. last I had the honour to write
          your Lordships directly hence by Capt. Bankes, and sent a 
          duplicate of the same via <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName>. I have herewith by a direct 
          opportunity forwarded duplicates of the Acts of Assembly, 
          some of which I since have found are in some measure difficient
          through the ignorance of great part of our Assembly and artifice 
          of one person whom I had some confidence in or my first arrival 
          when the ill condition I found <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Colony</placeName> in did not allow me 
          time to weigh and deliberate on them with that circumspection 
          I intend for the future. During the sessions of the late Assembly 
          I endeavoured pursuant to H.M. Instructions to recommend 
          the state and condition of the fortifications, which much wanted 
          all the assistance possible for their repair etc. (v. 11th Oct. 1730). 
          I did not find the major part of the Assembly averse at first, 
          but since they have been diverted from their good intentions 
          by the insinuations of one Mr. Colebrooke, their Speaker, who 
          imposed so long on their ignorance, that I was obliged to disolve 
          them, lest his behaviour might influence them to fall into 
          schemes yet more contrary to the good of the colony and their 
          own safety. Another Assembly is lately elected and still find 
          the effects of the above Mr. Colebrooke's influence on the most 
          ignorant of them, who are the majority, and whom he has 
          possess'd with notions of their being subject to the garrison, 
          which he publickly declared in the House he always detested 
          and abhorred, stiling it an arbitrary power and what the[y] 
          ought to oppose, though I never heard any complaints against 
          the garrison since my arrival. And he also attempts to take 
          from the Officers, and such of the soldiers of H.M. Garrison as 
          are equally freeholders with the inhabitants the liberty of voting 
          in common with their fellow subjects, so that I perceive I am 
          to expect but little publick service from the resolves of the 
          present Assembly ; being mostly influenced by him to oppose 
          any support towards the work of the fortifications, in which 
          designs I found he was assisted by one Mr. White who was of 
          H.M. Council here, and an old acquaintance of Mr. Colebrooke's, 
          and acted in concert with him in his designs to the great prejudice 
          of this Government, in which I was enough confirmed by 
          messages from his accomplices in the Assembly opposing the 
          country's assistance towards the fortifications, for which reasons, 
          at a meeting, being willing to acquaint the rest of the Council 
          therewith, I, in the most friendly manner, desired him and one 
          Mr. Jenner (who followed the same measure and was a dependant 
          on Mr. Colebrooke) to retire into another room whilst I advised 
          with the other Gentlemen of the Council, telling them it was on 
          something I did not judge proper then to mention before them, 
          till I had discoursed the rest present who were for going on with 
          fortifications. This affair happening on our receiving an 
          extraordinary message from the Assembly relating thereto and 
          and after having conversed with five of the Board present 
          wch. did not take up a quarter of an hour's time, I sent to 
          desire Mr. White to joyn and make a board as usual, but found 
          he was gone to consult his friend the Speaker of the Assembly, 
          and upon his being duly summonded the next morning he 
          refused to attend, which he signified by a letter to that purpose, 
          whereupon having first taken the advice of the Council present 
          and believing it more for the quiet of the Colony that I should 
          suspend him without entring the reasons at that Board, which 
          on extraordinary occasions as I humbly presume this was, I 
          made use of H.M. permission according to my Instructions 
          till H.M. pleasure be further known, and suspended him from 
          acting as one of the Council till that time, leaving Mr. Jenner 
          to declare his intentions which he often has since and refused 
          to attend the Council, abiding by what he had wrote in concert 
          with Mr. White. I am not in a state of health nor have I time 
          by this conveyance to trouble your Lordships further on this 
          affair but shall by next conveyance which I depend will happen 
          very soon after this and hope to do it from Carolina. I have 
          published H.M. order of 25th Sept. etc., since when we have 
          lost two sloops from this port, one of which we hear is carried 
          into <placeName ref="#cu_havana" role="direct">the Havana</placeName>. I daily expect the masters will be here to 
          make regular complaints thereof as prescribed by H.M. said 
          orders. Two sixty gun ships with warlike stores are lately 
          arrived at the Havana and as I am informed by a vessel lately 
          arrived thence they have encreased the number of regular forces 
          in that city and garrison and that my Lord Muskerry in H.M.S. 
          Adventure lay there ready to sail in her passage from <placeName ref="#jm" role="indirect">Jamaica</placeName>
          to <placeName ref="#es_cadiz" role="indirect">Cadiz</placeName>, with the money aboard her which was saved out of the 
          rich Spanish wreck some time since lost near Jamaica. The 
          present ill state of my health which has been lately much 
          impaired obliges me to have recourse to H.M. permission of 
          going to South Carolina for change of air, from whence I hope 
          to return in three weeks or a month, and that one or two of H.M. 
          ships will accompany me thence in order to make a demand of 
          our vessels (taken by the Spaniards) pursuant to H.M. orders. 
          Mr. White etc. was some time Chief Justice in this Colony 
          appointed by me, in which he acted with partiality and I have 
          displaced him from that office. He comes home by this 
          opportunity and as he has misconstrued almost everything I 
          have endeavoured to doe for the publick service, I have reason 
          to believe he may also misrepresent my actions in some sort of 
          complaints from himself or others by his and Mr. Colebrooke's 
          instigations, which I cant here yet be apprised of ; and I entreat 
          your Lordships goodness that I may be allowed time to answer 
          to anything of that kind before it has made any impressions to 
          my disadvantage, having done everything here to the best of 
          my judgement for the service of the publick, and if I should 
          have inadvertently been guilty of any mistake, it has not been 
          thro' want of zeal for H.M. service and the welfare of this 
          Colony, in which I shall always act with that integrity that 
          becomes a man of honour deserving your Lordships patronage 
          and protection. Acknowledges Additional Instruction of 2nd

          Mr. Popple to Col. Dunbar. Acknowledges letters of 
          2nd and 25th May, 5th and 16th June, 19th Aug., 15th and 21st 
          Sept. and 21st Oct. Continues : My Lords Commissioners 
          would sooner have given me their directions in answer, but 
          that the great dispute, relating to the claim of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusets Bay</placeName> 
          and of several private Proprietors to lands in that part of 
          <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName> where you are, is not yet determin'd ; But as the 
          Sollicitor of the Treasury has with the approbation of My Lords 
          Commissioners for Trade and Plantations laid before the 
          Attorney and Sollicitor General a full state of this matter for 
          their opinion in point of law, who are now hearing Council on 
          both sides thereon, it will shortly receive a decision. In the 
          mean time you are at liberty to lay out lands as directed by your 
          Instructions between the rivers <placeName ref="#rv_penobscot" role="boundary">Penobscot</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#rv_stcroix" role="boundary">St. Croix</placeName> and 
          their Lordships wish you success in such settlements as you 
          shall make there : But until the King's title to the lands between 
          <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="boundary">Kennebeck</placeName> and Penobscot shall be finally determined, you are 
          not at liberty to make any settlements there. But as to those 
          which you have already made in the neighbourhood of <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName>, 
          you will perceive by the duplicate of an Order to the Governor 
          of <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="direct">New England</placeName> which was sent you some time ago, that H.M. 
          has been pleased to direct that they shall not be disturb'd till 
          his further pleasure shall be known. And if the right shall 
          appear upon enquiry, to be in H.M., we apprehend the people 
          you have settled there will never be disturb'd. All settlements 
          to be made at or near <placeName ref="#ca_ns_annapolis_royal" role="direct">Annapolis Royall</placeName>
          and Canço or in any other part to the N.E. of Santa Croix are left entirely to the 
          direction and care of Colo. Phillips and therefore you will have 
          nothing more to do there but lay out the lands pursuant to Colo. 
          Phillipps' directions, but this may be done by your Deputies 
          that you may have the more leisure to comply with the other 
          parts of your duty elsewhere etc. Although you are directed 
          by your Instructions to lay out another hundred thousand acres 
          of land between the Rivers Penobscot and St. Croix, yet you 
          are not confin'd to any particular place but may mark them out 
          according to the best of your judgement even in the different 
          parcels if necessary, always taking care not to incroach upon 
          private property, and my Lords do not doubt your integrity in 
          the execution of this trust, And whereas their Lordships have 
          observed by the copies of the letters between Col. Phillipps and 
          you which you transmitted to the Board relating to this part 
          of the execution of your trust, that great difficultys did occur 
          to Col. Phillipps in the peopling of Nova Scotia, in case such 
          persons as were desirous to take up lands there should be oblig'd 
          to wait till the whole three hundred thousand acres proposed to 
          be reserved for the service of the Royal Navy should have been 
          mark'd out and set apart by you for that use, their Lordships 
          have represented this matter to H.M. and expect shortly to 
          receive his directions thereon. " My Lords taking notice of the 
          discouragement which you apprehend it may be to the settling 
          of lands to the Eastward, that the title to those lands tho' layed 
          out by you may hereafter be lyable to dispute have commanded 
          me to direct you, that Col. Philipps is directed by his Instruc- 
          tions to affix the Great Seal of the Province of Nova 
          Scotia to all such allotments of land as you shall set out to the 
          westward of St. Croix, whereby the titles to such lands will 
          become indisputable, and when any number of allotments 
          shall be ready for the Great Seal they may be sent all together 
          to Col. Philipps for his confirmation. My Lords Commissioners 
          have commanded me to send you a copy of the petition which 
          Mr. Waldo has presented to the King in relation to such claims 
          as are set up against H.M. title to the land between the Rivers 
          Kennebeck and Penobscot that you may transmit to them what 
          informations you can upon that subject, tho the validity of 
          these claims may possibly be determined before this letter can 
          reach you. Their Lordships presume you have sent duplicates 
          to the Admiralty of those letters to me wherein you complain 
          of the difficulties you lye under of obtaining right in the Courts 
          of Admiralty in New England on seizures and condemnations 
          in behalf of the Crown ; However I have received orders to 
          transmit copies of your letters to the Admiralty, and my Lords 
          will readily concur with the Lords of the Admiralty in anything 
          that shall be proposed for redressing that grievance. My Lords 
          do not make you any particular answer to what you say in 
          relation to the settling the bounds between the Massachusets 
          Bay and <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, because the Governor of those 
          Provinces having received very full Instructions from H.M. 
          has already laid them before the Assembly of New Hampshire, 
          and we hope they may have a very good effect. It is with 
          great concern that My Lords Commissioners have read that 
          part of your letters wherein you mention the ill usuage you 
          have met with in the execution of your employment, and they 
          are sorry to find that you have put yourself to any expence 
          beyond what the duty of your office required of you, because 
          of the difficulty which must attend the application for repay- 
          ment, in a case where no fund is appointed for that purpose : 
          But if the money which you have expended for the publick 
          service shall really appear to have produced some advantage,
          My Lords are very willing to recommend the repayment thereof 
          to the Lords of the Treasury, and for the future it will be 
          prudent for you to be very cautious how you engage in any 
          expence beyond what you are directed to make. Upon this 
          occasion you particularly mention your expence in prosecutions 
          and your opinion that the Advocate and Attorney General 
          may be ordered to attend them to make their demands home, 
          and that the fines imposed might not only pay this charge but 
          afford some small salary or travelling charges for them. My 
          Lords take it for granted that it is the duty of all the King's 
          Officers to assist you in these prosecutions and would be willing 
          to propose the fines as a fund for this purpose had they not 
          upon your recommendation to the Lords of the Admiralty 
          prepared Instructions to the several Governors of the Colonies 
          which have since been approved of whereby the King's moiety 
          of all fines is given to the Informer. My Lords observe what 
          you have wrote concerning the construction which is put upon 
          those Acts of Parliament which impose fines upon offenders in the woods in 
          <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">America</placeName>, and for your information in this particular 
          I am commanded to send you a copy of Mr. Fane's opinion 
          whereby you will perceive that fines imposed by English Acts 
          of Parliament are deem'd to be and must be paid in sterling 
          mony. My Lords Commissioners are very sorry to find by your 
          letters that your health is so much impaired as to incline you 
          to think of resigning your employment, should you yet have the 
          same intention my Lords would very willingly at your request 
          propose your brother Mr. Jeremiah Dunbar for your successor ; 
          but as the nomination of this Officer is not in them you might 
          by this step run the risque of losing your employment and your 
          brother not succeed you : My Lords therefore hope your health 
          will return and that your dilligence and fidelity in the execution 
          of what you have now in charge may lay a foundation for 
          recommending you to a less painfull employment. My Lords 
          Commissioners having at your request transmitted to the 
          Lords of the Admiralty the proceedings of the Vice Admiralty Court at 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="direct">Portsmouth</placeName> in the Province of New Hampshire, upon 
          an information exhibited by Arthur Slade, one of your Deputies 
          against Jeremiah Foolsom, for cutting ten white pine trees 
          without H.M. licence first had and obtained ; I am commanded 
          to inclose to you a copy of Dr. Sayer's opinion thereupon 
          whereby you will perceive that the person who prepared the 
          information against Foolsom laid the foundation for the decree 
          as it is pass'd, by admitting the said trees to have been cut 
          within the township of <placeName ref="#us_nh_exeter" role="direct">Exeter</placeName> which does not appear to have 
          been an offence within the Statute upon which the information 
          was grounded. You will therefore be more cautious for the 
          future in any prosecution upon the foot of this Act : But as 
          that pass'd in the second year of His present Majesty's reign 
          entitled an Act for better preservation of H.M. Woods in America 
          etc., is much more explicit, I am commanded to send you a copy 
          thereof for your better guidance in this particular. P.S. Since 
          the writing of this I have received and laid before my Lords 
          Commissioners your letter containing a narrative of your 
          proceedings from 17th Nov. 2nd Dec., which they will take 
          into consideration as soon as possible etc. [C.O. 218, 2. pp. 227-236.]</p>

          Governor Hunter to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. By this conveyance of the Enterprise, Capt. 
          Smith, Comr., I have the honour to acquaint your Lordships 
          that Capt. Dent arrived here on the 7th of this month with 
          four of the transports, the other two being arriv'd three days 
          before ; the officers are in good health etc. The Assembly now 
          sitting are come to some resolutions towards providing for them, 
          viz., that 20s. per week be paid to the commissioned officers and 
          5s. to private men after the provisions brought hither with them 
          are expended, for the Officers, from the day of their arrival here. 
          They have also resolv'd that 10£. pr. head be paid to officers and 
          soldiers for every rebel slave by them kill'd or taken alive and 
          are now preparing bills for the additional duty for one year 
          and a capitation of a shilling on slaves and three pence on cattle 
          for that expense besides the deficiency bill. I had before their 
          coming ordered all the houses that could be had at <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName>
          to be hired for their reception on their landing, but these upon 
          the view of their Quarter-Masters not being sufficient ; their 
          Officers thought it adviseable that they should continue on board 
          for a day or two till we could provide better, but hearing that 
          they began to sicken on board, I have ordered them to be landed 
          forthwith and what we cannot lodge at Port Royal to be sent 
          to <placeName ref="#jm_kingston" role="direct">Kingston</placeName> that we may discharge the transport.
          The Tartar was sent to cruize to windward with orders to the Officer commanding
          to detach six companys directly for <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName> 
          to save time and expense. They escaped him, I suppose in 
          the night and the cruizer is not yet return'd, but that number 
          shall be convey'd thither speedily, having on my first advice 
          ordered hutts and barracks to be built for them there, where 
          they are much wanted, the chief strength of the rebels being 
          near to that place. On the first of this month our Country 
          party fitted out for another attempt on these slaves set sail 
          from Port Royal for Port Antonio, under convoy, I have heard 
          nothing of them since, and expect little good from them, their 
          Commander of whom I had a very good opinion being arrested 
          contrary to law for a petty debt, and whilst in custody in the 
          Deputy Marshal's house barbarously murdered ; for which the 
          Marshal and his men are now in gaol in order for their trial next 
          Court. I am now very much busied in giving orders for the 
          repartition of the soldiers, it being judg'd by the Council, and 
          Assembly most for the service of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Island</placeName>  
          that they be barrack'd in several different parishes. I hope (by Capt. Dent 
          who is to sail in a short time) I shall be able to transmitt to your 
          Lordships the acts of this session etc. P.S. Capt. Brook who 
          had the command of the late party etc. (v. 24th Dec.), has been 
          mulct of his pay. Signed, Ro. Hunter. Endorsed, Reed. 19th,

          Lt. Governor Gooch to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Refers to account of negro conspiracy (v. 14th Sept., 1730). 
          Continues: Since which the negros, in the 
          countys of <placeName ref="#us_va_norfolk" role="direct">Norfolk</placeName> and
          <placeName ref="#us_va_princessanne" role="direct">Princess Anne</placeName>, had the boldness to 
          assemble on a Sunday while the people were at church, and to 
          chuse amongst themselves officers to command them in their 
          intended insurrection, which was to have been put in execution 
          very soon after : But this meeting being happily discovered 
          and many of them taken up and examined, the whole plot was 
          detected, for which the major part of them were severely 
          punished, and four of the ringleaders, on full evidence convicted, 
          have been executed. This, with the imprisonment and correction
          of some of the most suspected in the other parts 
          of the country, where the designs appeared not so far concerted, 
          have brought them now to be very quiet and submissive : But 
          as we cannot be too much on our guard against such desperate 
          combinations, I have ord'red the Militia to patrole twice or 
          thrice in a week to prevent all night meetings, and every man 
          to bring his arms to church on Sundays and Holydays, lest they 
          should be siezed by the slaves in their absence, if the same 
          mutinous spirit should be revived amongst them etc. By the 
          death of Colo. Page etc., there is a second vacancy at the Council 
          Board ; I hope the first is or will be speedily filled up by H.M. 
          appointment of Colo. Harrison whom I formerly recommended : 
          and I must heartily wish the second might be supplied by the 
          choice of Colo. Henry Armistead, a gentleman of a fair fortune 
          and character, and of the same county in which Colo. Page 
          lived ; and I am the more sollicitous for Mr. Armistead because that
          <placeName ref="#us_va_gloucester" role="direct">county of Glocester</placeName> is the most populous, 
          and where there are more negros than any other county in the Government, and 
          hath always had one sometimes more of the Council residing 
          in it, who had the direct command of the Militia, which in all 
          probability would not be very easie if put under the conduct 
          of another who had no estate or interest there. For these 
          reasons, as well as out of regard to the merit of Mr. Armistead 
          I humbly recommend him etc. But if Mr. Corbin's friends have 
          prevailed, and he is preferred to Colo. Harrison, or they still 
          insist on his being one of the Council, I must then intreat your 
          Lordships to interceed for Mr. Harrison in the place of Colo. 
          Page, postponing Mr. Armistead until another oppertunity ; 
          since the interest of the former in a frontier county, bordering 
          on the Indians, and where their impressions are generally directed, 
          may bring more advantage to the publick service, than the 
          inconveniency which may happen in the other county by Mr. 
          Armistead's present disapointment, if we must have Mr. Corbin. 
          I doubt not, my Lords, there are other persons here who on this 
          vacancy will endeavour (by some pretence or other, or by 
          forming of an interest among the merchants, perhaps a more 
          powerful application) to succeed Colo. Page. And I am appre- 
          hensive lest some posse[s]t with the ambition, whom I never 
          should have thought fit to insert in my list, do yet expect to 
          obtain it by an interest at home. But I beg your Lordships 
          will be pleased to allow some difference between a Governour's 
          personal knowledge and observation of the conduct and qualifi- 
          cation of men here on the spot, and the superficial knowledge 
          that can be attained by others, from an epistolary corres- 
          pondence ; or the judgment that can be framed of any person's 
          abilities in the Legislature of a country, and in dispensing of 
          Justice or the conducting affairs of Government, meerly from 
          the weight of his consignments. My Lords, the office of a judge 
          of the General Court, ought always to be considered in the choice 
          of a Councillor ; and it is the duty of a Governour to propose 
          none to be his assistants in the administration, but those whom 
          he knows zealous for H.M. service, and well disposed to promote 
          the publick good (especially now we are like to be under a new 
          law with respect to our trade, in which H.M. interest is so much 
          concerned) and admitting that he may sometimes be mistaken 
          in his men, it must be allowed strangers are more liable to be 
          imposed on ; and I cannot but lay it down as a principle founded 
          on reason and prudence, that in the choice of gentlemen for 
          publick offices, private affection ought not to be concerned, 
          unless there be sufficient ability and integrity in the person to 
          execute that trust, etc. Signed, William Gooch. Endorsed,

          obedience to H.M. commands, which I received 25th Sept., I 
          immediately issued proclamations throughout <placeName ref="#leeward" role="direct">this Government</placeName>, 
          informing all H.M. subjects here, whose ships or effects had 
          been pyratically taken, where and in what manner they might 
          apply for redress. I have had no application made to me since 
          for such redress, but in one case of a shallop drove on shore in 
          distress on <placeName ref="#gp" role="indirect">Guadeloup</placeName> with three men in her, who lost their 
          ship in the night, where she was seiz'd tryed and condemnd. 
          The men here applyd to the Judge of the Admiralty, and on 
          their declaring the facts, he gave them a declaratory sentence. 
          With this Capt. Barnesley, H.M.S. Scarborough, went to 
          Guadeloup to demand restitution. But in vain, etc. Signed,

          continue to meet in numbers in a most mutinous 
          manner, which the said merchants conceive to be with

          H.M. Lt. Governour in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> having directed me as Agent 
          for that Province to apply for H.M. royal confirmation of the 
          act for amending the staple of tobacco etc., offers answers to the 
          objections of the Commissioners of Customs etc. (v. 29th Dec., 
          1730). They were framed upon hearing one side only without 
          the Agent's being made acquainted with them till a copy of the 
          letter was sent to him signed, though he had applyed and 
          attended for that purpose etc. Repeats Lt. Governor Gooch's 
          arguments v. 23rd July, 1730. Replies he could not have any 
          other view in recommending this act than remedying the great 
          frauds in the tobacco trade etc. (i) As the Gentlemen of the 
          Assembly are planters, they are the best judges of the benefits 
          that will accrue to their trade from this law. The 3s. Virginia 
          money to be paid for inspecting and nailing the hhds. etc. is 
          a very small additional expence. Planters already pay 25. 
          or more for nailing and weighting. It was so far from being 
          intended to discourage the lower planters that the only act 
          that might affect them was repealed at the time of making 
          this, that of limiting the number of plants to be raised by each 
          tythable. (ii) Mr. Carkesse omits mentioning that the Crown 
          pays 1/2d. pr. lb. for all the bad tobacco burnt here. The Crown 
          will be saved this and the planter the freight etc. The bad sort 
          is so far from being most in request here, that the buyers here 
          will not give more than the duty for it, the consequence of which 
          is that the importer is obliged to send it abroad and then the 
          whole duty is drawn back and lost to the revenue, (iii) The 
          master is obliged by the Act of Parliament to swear to the 
          marks and number of hhds. on board, but they never swear 
          to the weight, which is most material to the revenue etc. The 
          Lt. Governor thought he had done eminent service to the 
          revenue in passing this act. It is continued only for three years, 
          in which time the advantage from it will manifestly appear. 
          Prays the Board to recommend it for confirmation etc. Signed, 
          Peter Leheup. Endorsed, Recd. 22nd, Read 23rd Feb., 1730/1.

        <p>Lt. Governor Gooch to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Having last night received a copy of a report 
          transmitted to your Lordships from the Commissioners of H.M. 
          Customs etc. (v. 29th Dec. 1730). I am greatly surprised to 
          find that Board influenced by the misinformations of persons, 
          who either know nothing of the tobacco trade, or wilfully 
          misrepresent it etc. Offers some remarks on their report, which 
          will convince all indifferent judges, that this act for amending 
          the staple of tobacco will really increase H.M. revenue. Answer 
          to 29th Dec., 1730. (i) Almost all the tobacco made by 
          the common people, (and they make the best), is sold to the 
          merchants in this country and the factors from the out-ports, 
          for cloathing and other necessaries which the planters want etc. 
          Their manner of dealing hitherto hath been that if a planter 
          wants but a pair of shoes at one of these stores, he must lay 
          out a whole hogshead of tobacco, seeing the merchant will not 
          receive a less quantity, neither will he deal at all, unless the 
          tobacco lyes convenient to his Receiver ; and by this means 
          the poor planter is often obliged to take goods that are of little 
          or no use to him, and at what price his neighbouring storekeeper 
          pleases to impose, because he cannot otherwise have what he 
          really hath occasion for ; This has indeed proved a discourage- 
          ment to many industrious people, and must in time obliged them 
          to leave off planting, and apply their labour to better purpose. 
          But by this act the greatest encouragement is given to the 
          common people to make tobacco that could be then thought 
          of : for after their tobacco hath passed an inspection, they may 
          take as many notes for it as they please ; i.e., notes for fiftys 
          or hundred pounds, dividing their tobacco into what parcels 
          they think proper ; these notes, the same as money, will be 
          accepted as payment at any store or shop, and as it is much 
          easier for a planter to carry home his goods, than to remove 
          his tobacco to the conveniency of the merchant, he will not 
          henceforward be confined to one particular merchant, but will 
          be at liberty to deal where he can meet with the best goods and 
          the best purchase. These advantages being what the common 
          planters see their account in, they are, and will be, more 
          particularly fond of the method proposed for payment in these 
          transfer notes, and will thereby be incited to apply themselves 
          to this manufacture with greater attention than they have 
          hitherto done, under the disadvantage of being stinted in their 
          plants, a low price and an useless return. As to lessening the 
          consumption by advancing the price, I can see no ground to 
          apprehend such a consequence : for since the rich and even 
          people of middling fortunes will ever be fonder of smoking good 
          than bad tobacco, be the price what it will ; so custom having 
          made smoaking as necessary as food to the labourer and 
          mechanick, it will not be an half-penny, or penny pr. pound 
          that will lessen the consumption of what they find necessary 
          to the gratification of their desires : but 'tis rather to be expected 
          that a more agreable tobacco will draw them into a greater 
          inclination to use a much larger quantity : Besides, that which 
          is sold at a very low price in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>,
          to the poor people, is not tobacco, but the stalks flatted and cut up by the tobacconists. 
          A commodity which ought not to be vended, the prohibiting 
          whereof must be submitted to the wisdom of the British 
          Parliament, (ii) This is answered by the fact that the poor 
          planters make the best tobacco etc. Believes there was the same 
          quantity of tobacco consumed in England when it was sold at 
          10d. pr. lb., as now, when it is sunk to 8d. or 7d. If there is no 
          tobacco so bad as to deserve to be burned as unmerchantable, 
          the King's revenue must be increased proportionately etc. 
          Further discussion of fraudulent running of tobacco etc. Con- 
          tinues : I must now beg your Lordships to consider some of the 
          consequences which must unavoidably follow the disallowance 
          of this act. (i) As the Tobacco trade is sunk to that degree that 
          abundance of the planters are no longer able to live by it, and 
          are in some hopes of relief from the regulations now proposed, 
          if that fails, they must of necessity leave off planting or starve 
          for want of cloathing and tools to work with, (ii) The last 
          session there was a considerable party in the House that opposed 
          this act, also strongly insisted on reducing the quantity of 
          tobacco to be planted to no more than 3000 plants for each 
          tithable, which in the most favourable year would hardly 
          amount to 20,000 hhds. But as I assured them I could pass 
          no such act, I had the good fortune, I must still cal it so, to 
          prevail with them to try this experiment, in which everybody 
          here sees how much the interest of the revenue has been con- 
          sidered, and if we are so unhappy to be disapointed in this, I 
          know no other expedient, consistent with H.M. interest, to 
          keep up the spirits of the people from sinking into despair of 
          ever being able to retrieve the miserable circumstances into 
          which the continued bad price of their tobacco for several years 
          past hath plunged them. And it is to be feared that many 
          poor familys will desert the country and retire to the new 
          settlements that are making in <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName>  
          to get out of the reach of their creditors. And what effect this must have on H.M. 
          revenue as well as the British trade, I humbly submit to your 
          Lordships. I cannot but express my concern, with an aching 
          heart my Lords, that any private representation of the state 
          of <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">this Colony</placeName>, or the interest of the people, 
          with regard to H.M. advantage, should have more weight with the 
          Commissioners of the Customs, than the united and deliberate sentiments 
          of the whole Legislature : and for my own part, tho' I had some 
          share in carrying this act in the Assembly, yet, I shal be  
          contented to own myself in the wrong, if any just arguments can 
          be brought against it, but hitherto I have heard of none. Some 
          are prejudiced against it from private interest others fancie 
          they know more of the trade than they really do, etc., and a 
          few, who being used to a beaten path of business, are unwilling 
          to go out of their way, tho' they are led in to a better and an 
          amended road. Before I conclude your Lordships will suffer 
          me to do justice to myself. Under the late repealed law of a 
          stint (of 6000 plants per tithable etc.), the country in a favourable 
          year made 40,000 hhds. of good and bad tobacco which was 
          constantly sent to <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>. All rents, and publick dues, 
          as the Parish, the Country, and the Country levies, which the 
          planters are to discharge by an equal tax pr. tithable, were paid, 
          it will be believed, not with their best tobacco ; insomuch, to 
          instance in one article only, the King's quit-rents, tobacco, 
          with the inconveniency the buyers were under in collecting 
          such tobacco, was generally sold from 3s. to 5s. pr. cwt. at the 
          same time that the current price all over the country was 10s. 
          and 12s. at least. Under this new law, which leaves every 
          planter at liberty to make as much tobacco as he can, it is taken 
          for granted, that the Colony in a seasonable year will make 
          about 60,000 hhds., and 'tis imagined, if the Inspectors do their 
          duty, that one fifth part or more will be destroyed as trash. 
          By which method the 45,000, or it may be 48,000 hhds. passed 
          will be all very good and fit for any market, and out of this the 
          quit-rents and all other dues will be paid, and the publick 
          tobacco will then sell for as much money in the country or 
          elsewhere, as any other. 'Tis also proposed, that by the 
          goodness of the tobacco we shal encourage an increase of the 
          consumption : and this act, my Lords, as far as we are able to 
          guard against frauds, secures the duty of all that is consumed 
          in G. Britain to the King etc. Maintains that the advantages 
          of the Customs and the interest of the people are so linkt 
          together by this apt disposition, that 'tis impossible for man 
          to devise a better. The delay caused will prevent the first year 
          being a proper trial, but if any defects are revealed, future 
          Assemblies will remedy them etc. Signed, William Gooch.

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. By all 
          opportunities I have done myself the honour of transmitting 
          to your Grace the account of my proceedings etc. Continues : 
          Since my last I have conven'd a new Assembly, which has been 
          sitting near three weeks. Encloses Journal. They have still 
          under their consideration the matter of the Govr.'s support 
          and what they will finally do in it, I am not able to say. But 
          according to the best judgment I can make, I don't expect they 
          will do anything that will come nearer to the King's Instruction, 
          than what was done by the last Assembly. As I have not been 
          wanting to do everything in my power for the King's honour 
          and service, so I am still determin'd to pursue my duty to the 
          King in all the ways I possibly can etc. The Agrent will wait 
          on your Grace with the copy of the process of the Jourts against 
          the rioters mentioned 14th Jan. etc. Continues : I don't 
          suppose Collo. Dunbar's pride and malice would stick at any- 
          thing (whether true or false) he thought would hurt me, so I 
          hope your Grace will prevent any orders to me for the future 
          from anything Collo. Dunbar may write till I am serv'd with a 
          copy to make answer etc. Repeats request for leave to sign Act 
          of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">N.H.</placeName> for emitting 6000£. etc., and asks that Benjamin Gambling, 
          a gentleman of good vertue, estate and capacity, and perfectly

          Thomas Lemont and two others, convicted for a 
          notorious riot in Sept. last, having seized a schooner 
          belonging to one Grover, who had put on board some 
          staves cut on a place possessed and improved by 
          Grover, his father and grandfather for 30 years, 
          Lemont etc. on a written order from Alexander 
          Hambleton, an officer under Col. Dunbar, who required 
          him to stop all such timber as should be cut and 
          transported from such a place without Col. Dunbar's 
          permission. They carried the schooner and stores 
          into <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName> harbour.
          Grover and his crew fled in fear of their lives owing to their threats. The 
          vessel continued there till she was seized by Major 
          Moulton, High Sheriff of the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="indirect">County of York</placeName>, who 
          apprehended the rioters etc. Agrees that this was

        <p>Mr. Fane to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          Reply to Feb. 19. I have reconsidered the acts of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> 
          referred to, and am humbly of opinion that H.M. cannot by any 
          instruction to his Governor vary or alter an Act of Assembly 
          ratified by the Crown, nor can H.M. in my humble apprehension 
          by virtue of an Instruction which the act of 1715 is observed 
          prevent his Governor granting or dissolving injunctions in causes 
          depending in Antigua whilst he is resident in any other island 
          of <placeName ref="#leeward" role="indirect">his Government</placeName>. Because as I am informed this practice 
          prevailed long before the act of 1715 took place : and I take 
          it that what was the usage in this particular before the act of 
          1715 is now by that act become a law of the island. It being 
          enacted by that law that all injunctions, subpoenas and other 
          process shall be granted signed and sealed by the Governour 
          as hath been usuall and no otherwise, and I know no method of 
          altering it, but by a subsequent law, and I begg leave to observe 
          to your Lordships that all regulations and amendments of the 
          law here have been made by Act of Parliament. Signed, Fran.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Duke of 
          Newcastle. Reply to 27th Feb. Continue : We do not find 
          anything in the papers your Grace has sent us, that shoud 
          incline us to alter our sentiments upon this subject, for not- 
          withstanding Mr. Belcher does in his letter deny that he ever 
          had any intention to march with an armed force in order to 
          demolish the fort at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="direct">Pemaquid</placeName>, and carry away the people 
          prisoners from thence, yet he does not deny that he ever told 
          Colo. Dunbar, that some Members of ye Assembly had such an 
          intention, and he does likewise acknowledge that ye Sherrif 
          of <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">York County</placeName> did march thither with his posse about that 
          time, tho' upon a different occasion, which might very justly 
          give Collo. Dunbar reason to be alarm'd, and he certainly would 
          have been wanting in his duty to ye King, if in that situation, 
          he had not apply'd to H.M. for an order to prevent hostilities 
          till such time at least as H.M. title to that tract of land should 
          be determined. It is not to be doubted but that Colo. Dunbar's 
          Office as Surveyor of the Woods, as well as his Instructions for 
          settling ye lands betwen <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="boundary">Kennebeck</placeName>

          rais'd him many enemies in <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">ye Massachusets Bay</placeName>, where it is 
          but too evident that every man who does his duty to the Crown, 
          makes himself liable to ye ill will of ye people ; and therefore 
          stands in need of all the support the Government can give him 
          from hence, for which reason it was, that we first beg'd your 
          Grace's favour on his behalf, and for ye same reason we now 
          take ye liberty to repeat that request, as apprehending that ye 
          employment of Lt. Gov. of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, may give him

          I lost my Major etc. Requests that his eldest Captain, Capt. 
          Hely may be appointed to succeed him etc. I suppose you 
          have heard of the defeat of the negros with an utter destruction 
          of all their habitations by a party of the country people who 
          attack'd them for an hour and a half without ever seeing one 
          of them, att length enter'd the town and after plundering itt, 
          laid itt in ashes, but took no one prisoner, this victory was 
          obtain'd with the loss only of two men. I believe we may now 
          naturaly conclude the war is over in this country. To-morrow

          Mr. Carkesse to Mr. Popple. Explains how the 
          Commissioners' report was framed without hearing Mr. Leheup. 
          They reply to his memorial (22nd Feb.). (i) As to the dirt, 
          rubbish which it is alledged the planters often mix with their 
          tobacco which tend to depreciate its esteem in foreign parts, 
          the officers in this port have met with no such instance, and if 
          the planters should do so, it would be no prejudice to the revenue 
          or any advantage to the importer, for it is liable to the same 
          duty as good tobacco, (ii) As to the great discoverys of frauds 
          that have been lately made here, for which great number of 
          officers have been dismist and others transported, the Commrs. 
          have good reason to believe that the prosecutions carried on have 
          put a stop to those frauds, but if not they do not apprehend 
          that a law passed in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName>, which can be of no force here, 
          can be any ways serviceable in preventing them, (iii) As to 
          ordinary or mean tobacco, the Commrs. are still of opinion 
          if by virtue of this law the importation thereof shoud be lessened 
          it will be prejudiciall to the revenue, it paying the same duty 
          as the best, tho' the revenue is not increased by what is shipt 
          off, yet the trade is thereby increased with the Northern countrys 
          they taking off great quantitys of this sort of tobacco, (iv) As 
          to the 1/2d. per lb. which the Crown pays for all bad tobacco burnt 
          here which charge Mr. Leheup says will by this act be saved, he 
          is misinformed, for the 1/2d. by law is not to be paid for such 
          tobacco as was damaged or unmerchantable in Virginia before 
          it was ship'd here, but only for such tobacco as happens to 
          receive damage by stress of weather or accident at sea etc., 
          which damage on ship board the Commrs. apprehend will 
          be increased by the Inspector's breaking the tobacco after it is 
          first packed before the shipping it being impossible to pack it 
          up again so close as it was at first, (v) As to the Navall Officer 
          sending over the exact quantitys of tobacco each ship takes on 
          board, there being no penaltys laid by this law as was observed 
          in my former letter, the Commrs. do not see any service 
          that can be to prevent the running of tobacco in <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>. 
          The other parts of Mr. Leheup's memorial relating to trade in 
          general, and not to this revenue, the Commrs. do not 
          think proper to make any observations thereon, but have 
          directed Mr. Fitzwilliams, Surveyor General for the Customs of 
          Virginia and other parts of the Southern Continent in America, 
          who has resided long in that country, and is an officer of whom 
          they have a very good opinion to wait on their Lordships to 
          answer such questions as they shall please to ask him relating 
          to this law etc. Signed, Cha. Carkesse. Endorsed, Recd. 12th

        <p>Mr. Fitzwilliam to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          In obedience to their commands has considered the Act of 
          <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> for amending the staple of tobacco, and con- 
          ceives it "to be highly prejudicial to the British merchants 
          trading to that country ; that it lays the poorer sort of planters 
          under such difficulties as in a short time must oblige them to 
          leave off planting, and betake themselves to some manufacture ; 
          that it vests such a power in Inspectors as no sett of men ought 
          to be entrusted with " etc. Explains at length. Mr. Leheup is 
          wrong in saying that the 3s. for stamps and nailing etc. will be but 
          a small expense to planters, for by the present custom of buying 
          nearly 4 lbs. of the tobacco pays nothing in the country for 
          weighing and nailing. Continues : As to what is alledged of 
          the planters being the best judges of what benefit will accrue 
          to their own trade, if that be admitted, yet I presume they are 
          not to be allowed proper judges of the Trade and Navigation of 
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> etc. If we look back but a very few years, we 
          may observe very extraordinary steps taken in the Governmt. 
          of Virginia to lessen, as much as in them lyes, both the revenue, 
          and the trade, by discouraging everybody from making tobacco, 
          in order to gain a monopoly etc. In 1726 there was a law passed 
          in Virginia for the more effectual preventing the bringing of tobacco 
          from N. Carolina etc., which is an effectual prohibition on 
          the people of <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="indirect">North Carolina</placeName> to plant tobacco. For that 
          province has no ports capable of admitting ships of burthen, 
          etc., and as Virginia has hitherto been the port from whence the 
          tobacco of that province has been conveyed to Great Britain, 
          the lessening of H.M. revenue must be the consequence of this 
          prohibition. But what makes the act still more extraordinary 
          is, that it is repugnant to an act of Parliament, notwithstanding 
          which, penalties have been recovered contrary to this act of 
          Parliament in the Courts of Common Law of Virginia, which 
          has lessened the importation of tobacco betwen 2 and 3000 
          hhds. yearly etc. Refers to his letter of Dec. 1727. Continues : 
          Upon an application made to the Parliamt. last sessions, the 
          law for preventing the importation of stemm'd tobacco, or 
          tobacco stripped from the stalk, was repealed, whereby the 
          quantity of tobacco usually stripped from Virginia was lessen'd 
          at least 6000 hhds. more, as may appear from the Customhouse 
          books, yet this indulgence, wch. consequently lessens the trade 
          of Great Britain to that country at least 20 sail of ships yearly, 
          had not satisfied them, but now in 1730 they pass this act of 
          their own, in order further to lessen the quantity of this com- 
          modity, whereby they propose to raise the price by preventing 
          the poorer sort of people from planting which must materially 
          give them a turn to manufacturing etc. As to the Lt. Governor's 
          interest in the act, besides his influence in settling the rent of 
          the warehouses, which is near equal to giving an employmt., 
          he will have the disposal of the new offices created by this act 
          to the value of near 6000£. pr. annum etc. Concludes : It is 
          generally computed that the execution of this act will cost the 
          country between 10 and 12,000£. a year etc. The inhabitants 
          have not yet been at any expense in building warehouses etc. 
          for executing it. There was a law of this nature in Virginia 
          called the Agents law, abot. 13 or 14 years agoe, which tho' 
          not near so bad in its consequences, was repealed as being 
          prejudicial to the trade of Great Britain. Signed, Rd.

          Capt. Coram to Mr. Popple. I have understood there

          of the vast great planks of oak and fir timber, and iron oar 
          which I found abounding at a place call'd <placeName ref="#us_ma_taunton" role="direct">Taunton</placeName>, on a

          much more by water, in some like manner as Winchester is

          thither thre years before for establishing shipbuilding in New 
          England, and removed them to Taunton to build a ship of 140 
          tonns (the first ship or vessel that ever had been built on that 
          river) and had all the ironwork or much the greater part thereof 
          used in building her made out of the iron oar of that place and 
          wrought into bolts and spikes and nailes etc., by an engenious 
          fellow named Robert Grossman born at that place, and was 
          since the Representative for the same many years in the General 
          Assembly of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts</placeName>. I built several more and larger 
          ships there soon after, and there has been built since above 500 
          ships on the same river, and I doubt not but with the ironworke 
          for them, the natural produce of the same place wch. also

          published in a very large folio anno 1721 by subscrip- 
          tion from many of the Nobility and great Officers of 
          Britain as well as others called A New General Atlas, 
          the maps in which are engraved or revised by Senex, 
          have, to the scandal of the Nation, unadvisedly inserted 
          into it that Map of Louisiana as a proper description 
          of that country, without any alteration or restriction, 
          by which, as far as the authority of that book can 
          contribute, they give up to the French all their 
          exorbitant claims to the greater part of these British 
          Dominions, which whether it may deserve the notice 
          of your Honourable Board is humbly submitted, but 
          it cannot but give those who have considered the 
          mistake and have any concern for the honour and 
          interest of the Crown of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>
          a very just resentment. The boundary of Pensylvania to the 
          Southward is a circle about Newcastle at 12 miles 
          distance so farr as that reaches, and from thence a 
          line running directly west is to divide it from Maryland. 
          This line in the Royal grants for both Provinces is 
          called the fortieth degree of Northern Latitude, which 
          occasions a very high dispute, for it is most evident 
          by both patents, that at the respective times of the 
          grants, it was not conceived, that what is commonly 
          understood by the 40th degree of latitude would 
          extend near so far northward on the land, as it is now 
          found from later observations by more exact land 
          instruments. Maryland in the patent to Lord 
          Baltemore seems positively limited to <placeName ref="#rv_delaware" role="boundary">Delaware Bay</placeName>
          which ends somewhat to the southward of Newcastle 
          etc. The whole tenour of that grant appears to bound 
          it by the heads of the Bay of Delaware and Chesapeak. 
          It can also be clearly proved, that the first grantee of 
          Maryland understood his province to be bounded by 
          the head of Chesapeak Bay, and about 1683 not much 
          above one year after Mr. Penn first arrived here with 
          his people to settle his Colony, the then Lord Baltemore 
          being himself in these parts thought fitt to run a line 
          a few miles above the head of the said Bay, to which 
          line he formally made his claim, and to that boundary 
          as allow'd on the part of Maryland this Province has 
          ever since extended its settlements, and great numbers 
          of families near 50 years since sate down and laid out 
          their substance in improving the said lands, and raising 
          estates, which have descended to their children etc. 
          Yet now from the later discoveries that have been 
          made of the latitude, Maryland would extend their 
          countrey much higher and take to themselves a con- 
          siderable part of those estates : But our inhabitants 
          have hitherto held their possessions. The claim 
          nevertheless on the part of Maryland still subsisting 
          occasions great uneasiness amongst the people. And 
          tho' the respective Governors, who live in a good 
          understanding with each other, have hitherto shewn, 
          and still continue to use, such moderation and caution 
          on both sides, as that no violences, by the countenance 
          of either Government, have been committed, yet it is 
          of vast importance to the publick peace and security 
          of H.M. good subjects, as well as for the interest of the 
          Proprietors, that this dispute should with as little 
          delay as possible be effectually ended, (iii) Describes 
          Constitution and Courts, (iv) The shipping annually 
          cleared from <placeName ref="#us_pa_philadelphia" role="direct">Philadelphia</placeName>, 
          <placeName ref="#us_de_newcastle" role="direct">Newcastle</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#us_de_lewes" role="direct">Lewes</placeName>, the 
          three ports of trade within this Government, are 
          computed to be about 170, and as they consist chiefly 
          of sloops and small briganteens they cannot be reckoned 
          one with another to exceed 60 tons with a complement 
          of 7 men to each vessel etc. For these last ten years 
          the shipping are encreased one full third, (v) As this 
          with all other of the American Provinces are limited 
          to trade only with Britain, and H.M. Colonies, and no 
          goods from Britain pay any duties, there is therefore 
          no occasion to have any such entries made as can 
          enable us to render an exact account of the quantities, 
          but the sorts are generally such dry goods as are con- 
          sumed in Great Britain vizt. woollens, linens, silks, 
          habedashry etc. necessary for apparell, ironware 
          and other necessaries for husbandry building and 
          furniture of houses, (vi) There is no considerable 
          trade between this Government and any foreign 
          Plantations ; what there is, is chiefly with the Dutch 
          vizt. three or four small vessells in a year to <placeName ref="#gr" role="indirect">Surinam</placeName>, 
          perhaps one to <placeName ref="#curacao" role="indirect">Curaçoa</placeName>, and sometimes one to
          <placeName ref="#steustatius" role="indirect">St. Eustacia</placeName>, but none to any French or Spanish
          Plantations. Our exports thither are bread, flour, staves, 
          butter and some horses, and our returns are chiefly 
          melasses, some little rum and sugar. Our trade to 
          <placeName ref="#europe" role="indirect">Europe</placeName> is but casual, and according as there is demand 
          for grain, in which case, as in the late scarcity of wheat 
          in Europe about 40,000 bushels were shipt from hence to
          <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName>, <placeName ref="#pt_lisbon" role="indirect">Lisbon</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">the Streights</placeName>, but when there 
          are plentifull crops we ship little or none. To <placeName ref="#madeira" role="indirect">Madeira</placeName>
          there is shipt annually between 15 and 20,000 bushels 
          of wheat, some Indian corn and bread, in return for 
          which we have their wines. We now also sometimes 
          import salt from <placeName ref="#pt" role="indirect">Portugal</placeName>
          or <placeName ref="#es" role="indirect">Spain</placeName>, tho' rarely, most 
          of it being brought from the <placeName ref="#indies" role="indirect">West Indies</placeName>,
          (vii) At Philadelphia there are a Naval Officer, a Collector and 
          Comptroller, at Newcastle and Lewes a Naval Officer 
          and Collector each, who guard the trade, and all proper 
          care is taken to prevent any illegal practices therein, 
          so that notwithstanding the vigilancy of the Officers, 
          there are but very few forfeitures on that score, (viii) 
          The produce of this country and stapl: commodities 
          are wheat and Indian corn for exportation, rye, barley, 
          oats and buckwheat enough for home consumption, 
          but very little exported. Wheat manufactured into 
          flour and bread, barrell'd beef and pork in a reasonable 
          proportion to suit the cargoes of bread and flour for 
          the West Indies, hogshead and barrell staves in great 
          quantities are shipt off annually to the West Indies, 
          Madeira, Lisbon etc. ; skins and furrs (which are pur- 
          chased of the Indians in exchange of woollens, linens, 
          shott cutlery etc. all from Britain) with some pigg 
          iron annually are shipt off for Great Britain, also ships 
          built here make a considerable return, and our exports 
          in the whole may be computed at about 70,000£., or 
          80,000£. sterl., but make less or more according to the 
          markets they meet with. In return to our exports to 
          the W. Indies we have litle else than rum in but too 
          large quantities, with melasses and sugar which are 
          consumed in the country. Divers undertakers here, in 
          hopes of making large returns by iron, have to theire 
          very great cost erected furnaces, but the low price of 
          pigg iron in Britain for these two years past has proved 
          a very great discouragement and disappointment, so 
          that some of these furnaces are like to fall. Great 
          endeavours have also been used, with a bounty from 
          the Government, to promote the raising of hemp, in 
          expectation of making a return by it to Britain, but 
          very litle as yet has been exported. We have also 
          hopes that the raising of silk, which has been tried 
          with some success, may in time be pursued by the 
          inhabitants, our climate and soil very well agreeing 
          with the silkworm, and mulberry tree, (ix) We know 
          of no mines as yet but iron, and some litle copper, of 
          which last in this Province no discoveries have as yet 
          been made that countervail the trouble and charge. 
          (x) This Government has not hitherto had occasion to 
          use any method that can furnish us with an exact 
          estimate, but as near as can at present be guessed there 
          may be about 45,000 souls of whites and 4000 blacks, 
          (xi) The inhabitants have been exceedingly encreased 
          within these last ten years by means of their continued 
          resort hither from Great Britain, Ireland, <placeName ref="#de" role="indirect">Germany</placeName>
          etc. from which two last we have of late had great 
          numbers, and 'tis beleived within these ten years the 
          inhabitants have encreased above one half of what 
          they were before (xii, xiii). This being an inland 
          Province no forts have been built, nor is there any 
          formed Militia in it. (xiv) The number of Indians 
          inhabiting this Province is very much decreased, and 
          those which remain scarce exceed 600 men, excluding 
          the five Nations etc., and at the first settlement of this 
          Colony such measures were taken with them by Mr. 
          Penn, which are still carefully continued, that they 
          have lived in perfect peace with the inhabitants, and 
          they are very well affected to the British interest, 
          (xv) As to the strength of the neighbouring Indians, 
          encloses a paper drawn up in 1718 by Mr. Logan, a 
          gentleman of good literature and large experience, 
          who having been himself engaged in the Indian trade, 
          from the informations he collected from some who 
          had long and often travelled through <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName>, and the 
          country about <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="indirect">Missassippi</placeName>, drew up at the request of 
          Sir Wm. Keith then Governor of this Province an 
          account of the French trade, their routes and their 
          Indians, etc., to be transmitted to your Board in answer 
          to some queries then sent him. How Sir William 
          might transmitt it I know not, but as it appears to me 
          curious and valueable, with that gentleman's leave, 
          who has lent me his original draught, I here give you 
          an exact copy etc. (xvi, xvii). All claims of the 
          Spaniards lye so remote, that no occasion has been 
          given us to have any knowledge of, or concern about, 
          them. The French of Canada are much nearer neigh- 
          bours, but fall principally under the notice of H.M. 
          Government of New York, from whence undoubtedly 
          the best informations may be had : yet Mr. Logan's 
          paper may give your Lops, considerable information, 
          (xviii) Revenue : By the emission of a paper currency, 
          an annual interest arises thereon amounting to near 
          3000£. this currency, which with a small excise on 
          spirits not amounting to 1000£. yearly raise together 
          a sufficiency to answer all the present exigencies of 
          this Government, (xix) By order of the Assemblies 
          annually there is generally paid to the Governor about 
          1200£. pr. annum besides perquisites ; some further 
          allowances are likewise made to the Provincial Judges, 
          Treasurer, Attorney General and Trustees of the Loan 
          Office, the bounties also and charge of Indian Treaties 
          take a part but generally at the end of the year the 
          accounts are near a balance, (xx) There are no 
          establishments here, for there being no Militia, there 
          is consequently no military one, and the Officers of the 
          Government have either such annual allowances made 
          to them as the Assemblies think proper, or the fees of 
          their offices as established by our laws, and generally 
          they hold their places by commission from the 
          Proprietor or his Lieutenant during pleasure. Signed,

        <p>Paper drawn up by Mr. Logan in 1718, referred to 
          in preceding. The memorial of which the Lords 
          Commissioners have transmitted a copy etc. appears 
          well-grounded. 'Tis well known that ever since the 
          expedition of the Sieur La Salle, the French have 
          claimed all the lands to the northward and westward 
          of the British Colonies, from <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName> along the Lakes 
          and <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="indirect">Messassippi River</placeName>, in which they further strengthen 
          themselves, by alledging, that the Article in the Treaty 
          of Reswick, by which all lands or rivers in America 
          of the mouth of which either nation were then possessed 
          are conceded to that nation as high as the first sources 
          of those rivers, is a full cession of all that tract of land 
          to the French : tho' it cannot be probable that it was 
          ever so intended, because 'tis not only inconsistent 
          with the ancienter grant from the Crown to the Proprietors
          of <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="indirect">Carolina</placeName>, but with the security of all the 
          British Colonies on this <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">Continent of America</placeName>. From 
          the time of their first discoveries of Missassippi they 
          have with great care settled a communication between 
          Canada and the <placeName ref="#us_la" role="indirect">Southern countries</placeName> on that river, for 
          which they have three different routes all of which are 
          the same as far as <placeName ref="#lk_erie" role="indirect">Lake Erie</placeName>.
          They sail in canoes from <placeName ref="#ca_qc_montreal" role="indirect">Montreal</placeName>
          abt. 3 leagues to the <placeName ref="#lachine" role="indirect">fall of St. Louis</placeName>, where 
          they have a portage or carrying place by land of about 
          half a league, then they reimbarque row up the stream 
          about 60 leagues to <placeName ref="#ca_on_frontenac" role="indirect">fort Frontenac</placeName> on the north side, 
          and at the beginning of <placeName ref="#lk_ontario" role="indirect">Lake Ontario</placeName>; In this fort is 
          a small garrison consisting of one or two companies in 
          the King's pay, from thence they proceed on the Lake 
          Ontario generally reputed to be 80 leagues in length 
          to those dreadfull <placeName ref="#niagarafalls" role="indirect">Falls of Niagara</placeName>, which oblige them 
          to land, the portage is about three leagues, after 
          reimbarquing, they goe up the <placeName ref="#rv_niagara" role="indirect">Strait</placeName> about 6 leagues, 
          after which they enter Lake Erie which they call 130 
          leagues in length. The shortest passage from hence 
          to Missassippi by water is to goe up
          <placeName ref="#rv_maumee" role="indirect">the river of the Miamies or Oumamies</placeName>
          that enters Lake Erie on the 
          Southwest about 150 leagues, they then come to 
          another carrying place of about 3 leagues, where the 
          highest land is, and from hence the waters divide their 
          descent between Missassippi and that lake, there they 
          imbarque on a small shallow river called La Riviere 
          de Portage, down which they row 40 leagues, to the 
          <placeName ref="#rv_wabash" role="indirect">River Wabash or Ouabache</placeName>, and on that river 
          according to the traders reckoning 120 leagues to the
          <placeName ref="#rv_ohio" role="indirect">river Ohio</placeName>, into which the other falls, then 80 leagues down 
          Ohio to Missassippi and thence 350 leagues to the
          <placeName ref="#gf_mexico" role="indirect">Bay of Mexico</placeName>. Some call both these rivers by the same 
          name, and generally Wabache, but they ought to be 
          distinguished, because the head of Ohio comes much 
          more easterly, extending even to the Government of <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="indirect">New York</placeName>
          towards <placeName ref="#us_va" role="indirect">Virginia</placeName> or Carolina, and among 
          divers other large streams it receives the <placeName ref="#rv_tennessee" role="indirect">River Peresippi</placeName>
          on the south side, not far from the mouth 
          of Wabache, which river of Perisippi is said to rise in 
          the mountains of Virginia and Carolina. The other 
          two passages are both prick'd down in Hennepin's 
          map, according to the accounts given are thus. From 
          the North-west of Lake Erie they sail 8 leagues to a 
          fort on <placeName ref="#lk_stclair" role="indirect">Lake St. Claire</placeName> called Erie
          <placeName ref="#us_mi_fortdetroit" role="indirect">Pont Chartrain</placeName>
          where there is a settlement of the French, and often 
          400 traders meet here, then along the Lake 7 leagues, 
          thence to the great <placeName ref="#lk_huron" role="indirect">Lake Huron</placeName> about 10 leagues, 
          on this lake they proceed to the <placeName ref="#mackinac">Straits of Missilimakina</placeName> 
          120 leagues, here is a Garrison of about 30 French, 
          and a vast concourse of traders, sometimes not less 
          than a thousand besides Indians, being a common 
          place of rendezvous. At or near this place are the 
          Outawas settled. From Lake Huron they pass by 
          the strait Misilimakina 4 leagues being 2 in breadth, 
          and of a great depth to the <placeName ref="#lk_michigan" role="indirect">Lake Illinois</placeName>, thence 150 
          leagues on the Lake to Fort Miami situate on the 
          mouth of the <placeName ref="#rv_chicago" role="indirect">River Chigagow</placeName>. This fort is not 
          regularly garrison'd, from hence came those Indians 
          of the same name vizt. Miamies, who are settled on 
          the aforementioned river that runs into Erie. Up 
          the River Chigagow they sail but 3 leagues to a portage 
          of a quarter of a league, then they enter a small Lake 
          of about a mile, and have another very small portage, 
          and again another of 2 miles to the <placeName ref="#rv_illinois" role="indirect">River Illinois</placeName>, 
          thence down the same 130 leagues to Missasippi. The third is from 
          Misilimakina on Lake Illinois to the <placeName ref="#by_green" role="indirect">Lake des Puans</placeName>
          90 leagues, thence to the <placeName ref="#rv_fox" role="indirect">River Puans</placeName> 80 
          leagues, thence up the same to a portage of about 4 
          miles over to the <placeName ref="#rv_wisconsin" role="indirect">River Ouisconsing</placeName>, thence 40 leagues 
          to Missassippi. From the mouth of Ouisconsing to 
          the mouth of the River Illinois is reputed about 150 
          leagues on Missasippi, and from thence to the mouth 
          of Ohio 70 leagues etc. These distances are as the 
          traders reckon them, but they appear to be generally 
          overdone, which may be owing to those people's 
          coasting along the shores of the Lakes, and taking in 
          all the windings of the rivers. The French use their 
          utmost endeavours to bring over all the Indians into 
          their interest, the Iroquese or five Nations have stood 
          chiefly in their way, but by their Jesuites and other 
          means they daily debauch them from the English. 
          The number of the whole is not now above 2000 fighting 
          men, of which the French have drawn over 700 to 
          inhabit amongst themselves, vizt. 400 seated at the 
          Fall of St. Louis on the south side of <placeName ref="#rv_stlawrence" role="indirect">St. Laurence</placeName> and 
          300 on the north side, the rest of them are planted 
          chiefly along the Lake Ontario at some distance from 
          it. There are no Indians in the French interest on 
          this side of St. Laurence nearer than the Miamies or 
          Twechtwese as the Iroquese call them who are about 
          2000 seated chiefly on the aforementioned river 
          Miamis flowing into Lake Erie and on or near the 
          branches of Oubache. The Illinois are about 3,000 men 
          on and near the river of that name. The Misilimakinaes 
          or Outtawas were formerly 3000 but now are scarce 500. 
          The Nokes 100, the Fellesavoins 200, the Sakes 200, the 
          Puans 600. All these joyned with the French against 
          the Iroquese, and all of them except the Mimaies are
          seated about or near to the Lake Illinois, which is now 
          commonly call'd by them Mechegan, and on the rivers 
          that run into it, and on Lake Puans and the River 
          Illinois. There are also divers other nations between 
          Mechegan and Missasippi, as the Renards or Foxes, 
          Massekobins, Kikapous, but these being further off, 
          did not joyn the French against the Iroquese. On 
          Missasippi and the branches of it there are many great 
          Nations, especially to the West as the Missouris, 
          Ozages, Acansias, who are different from those of 
          Acansa on the East, with many more, not less as is 
          affirmed, than 60,000 men, with all of whom the French 
          have peace and some alliance. On the other hand all 
          the English to the northward of Carolina have not 
          1500 men in their interest excepting the Iroquese. In 
          <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="secondary">New England</placeName> and
          <placeName ref="#us_ct" role="secondary">Connecticut</placeName> they have very few. In
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="secondary">New York</placeName> they have only the River Indians besides 
          the Iroquese. In <placeName ref="#us_nj" role="secondary">Jersey</placeName> and
          <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="secondary">Pensylvania</placeName> their own 
          or home Indians called Delawares are exceedingly 
          decreased, and being in subjection to the Iroquese 
          take their rules from them. In <placeName ref="#us_md" role="secondary">Maryland</placeName> and Virginia 
          there are very few, excepting those whom Colonel 
          Spottswood with great industry has lately established 
          there. Those of Carolina and the nations lately in 
          friendship have been very numerous. But the 
          Iroquese, whether prompted by the French, or 
          from what other cause is not yet known, have of 
          late years made great inroads upon them, and cannot 
          as yet by any endeavours of the English be diverted 
          from it. But of all these people the best accounts will 
          naturally come from Carolina.           
          The methods that may be proposed to prevent the 
          designs of the French seem to be these, (i) To use all 
          reasonable endeavours to preserve the Iroquese, tho' 
          the English of Virginia and Carolina are very much 
          incensed against them, and the French endeavour to 
          animate all the other English to the northward in the 
          same manner, as being a bloody, barbarous and 
          imperious people, at the same time that they them- 
          selves cajole them, and endeavour by all means to 
          make them their own. Yet their preservation seems 
          to be of vast importance to us. (ii) To encourage the 
          Government of Virginia to extend their settlements 
          beyond <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="indirect">the mountains</placeName>, over which the present 
          Governour has happily discovered passes, and to build 
          some forts on Lake Erie with the concurrence of the 
          Iroquese settled not far from thence : Colonel Spottiswood
          had this in view, till discouraged by the repeal 
          of their act for the Indian trade, the consequence of 
          which act 'tis doubted was not clearly enough understood, 
          (iii) To encourage and support the trade of 
          South Carolina who have very good opportunities of 
          making alliances with all the Indians to the southward 
          of the Lakes, and to the east of Missasippi. To which 
          their grant from the Crown gives them a very good 
          claim, (iv) To give such orders and instructions to 
          the Governours that they take special care of the 
          commerce with the Indians, that while they endeavour 
          to promote the trade of their own people, they shall 
          do nothing to weaken the interest of other Colonies 
          to which traders are too subject ; gain being their 
          only view. By these means all the Indians, with 
          whom we have any commerce, may be very much 
          united to the British interest, for the Indians being 
          supplied generally with better goods (excepting fire 
          arms, powder and some trinketts) and at easier rates 
          by the English than the French, they will choose to 
          deal with us rather than with them, and their interest 
          in this is commonly the strongest tie upon them. 
          The French indeed seem to exceed us in industry, and 
          in accommodating themselves to the humours of those 
          barbarous people, and they have now a vast number 
          of bold expert traders whom they call coureurs de bois, 
          who generally are as capable of the fatigues of long 
          journeys and fighting by ambush in the woods, the 
          common way of making war amongst them, as any 
          of the savages : Yet some of Virginia and Carolina 
          have shewn that they are scarce to be exceeded that way.

          Governor Hunter to the [? Duke of Newcastle]. Since 
          my last, a copie of which is inclos'd, the several companys of 
          two regiments have been sent to their respve. quarters where 
          it was judg'd they might be of most use, and barracks built, 
          where there are not finisht they are quarter'd by the parish'oners. 
          The private men are generally in good health and condition, 
          but of the officers, Major Brandreth, and Captn. Moloy of Coll. 
          Hayes, and Capt. Ballenden and Lieut. Sutton of Coll. Cope's 
          regiment are dead. That the service may not suffer, upon 
          application from the commanding officers, etc., I have order 'd 
          out commissions etc., detailed. Continues : The officers are 
          preferr'd according to their seniority and service, and I hope 
          H.M. will confirm their commissions. There are absent three 
          Captains and 7 subalterns. Our countrey party, consisting of 
          about 180 men were march'd from their place of rendezvous 
          before the regiments arriv'd. They had the luck to surprize 
          <placeName ref="#jm_nannytown" role="direct">the chiefe negro setlement</placeName>
          in the neighbourhood of <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName> 
          gott into the town with the loss of two men and a few wounded 
          the negro's set fire to that part of their town next to the 
          mountains and fled thither under the cover of the smoak. Our 
          party did not pursue but kept in the town three days and on 
          the fourth burnt it consisting of a hundred and six houses, and 
          retir'd to Port Antonio : I have order'd them immediately back 
          thither, if the officer finds them in good heart and willing, if 
          otherwise, to disband them : for they left it contrary to my 
          orders and have not taken one pris'ner. By the advice of the 
          Council and at the desire of the most substantial merchts. and 
          inhabitants, I have dissolv'd the Genll. Assembly, issu'd writts 
          for calling a new one, and our elections begin to-morrow. If 
          the gentlemen who desir'd the dissolution will exert themselves 
          we may hope for a better, but it can not well be worse : men of 
          desperate fortunes who want protection, and some of desperate 
          principles who want confusion will ever be the most active 
          and industrious to gett in but I hope the people's eyes 
          are opened etc. Will write by Capt. Dent, who is to depart

          <placeName ref="#us_ny_putnam" role="direct">'Equivalent land'</placeName> because the same was formerly 
          taken from the <placeName ref="#us_ct" role="direct">Colony of Connecticut</placeName>, in lieu of the 
          like quantity yielded to that Colony by the Province 
          of New York upon the settling of their respective 
          boundarys, which tract of land is scituate between the 
          antient easterly bounds of New York upon the main 
          land, and the present westerly bounds of Connecticut, 
          bounded towards the north by the south line of the 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="boundary">Colony of the Massachusetts Bay</placeName> at about twenty 
          miles distance from <placeName ref="#rv_hudson" role="boundary">Hudsons River</placeName> etc. The said 
          tract hath never yet been granted to any person by 
          the Crown, but if the same were duly settled and 
          improved under a grant thereof from your Majesty, 
          it might be rendered greatly advantagious to this 
          Kingdom in the production of hemp, pitch, tarr, and 
          other kinds of naval stores, and is well scituated for 
          cultivating a furr trade with the Indian Nations in 
          that neighbourhood. Propose to settle it with 100 
          persons within 7 years and more as they find encouragement,
          and to pay 2s. 6d. per 100 acres, the same quit-

          Governor Johnson to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. By this conveyance, I have at the desire of the 
          Council and Assembly, transmitted to his Grace the Duke of 
          Newcastle, their humble address to his Majesty. The Assembly 
          are fallen upon business and am in great hopes I have brought 
          them to a disposition to settle the distracted affairs of 
          <placeName ref="#us_sc" role="direct">the Province</placeName>, but nothing is yet brought to maturity,
          so as to transmit to your Lordships. The Assembly insist upon the 
          priviledge of appointing their own Clerk ; I apprehend it is 
          H.M. Prerogative to appoint that and all officers, and I insisted 
          upon it with them ; but they plead custom, and having always 
          been allowed that priviledge, both in the Proprietors and Mr. 
          Nicholson's time, and given instances of <placeName ref="#bb" role="indirect">Barbados</placeName>
          and other Colonies in America, having the same ; at last I told them I 
          would dispence with their doing it for the present, till H.M. 
          pleasure should be signifyed to me thereupon. I therefore beg 
          to be particularly instructed on this head. Signed, Robt.

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. As I conceive no words can represent 
          the state of <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">this Island</placeName>, and 
          the conduct of the present General Assembly so clearly, and 
          justly, as their own votes, I have the honour of transmitting 
          them herewith to your Grace, from the first meeting of the 
          present General Assembly, to the 19th instant inclusive : this 
          last day of their meeting they passed a petition to H.M. upon 
          the subject matter of the report of the Committee appointed 
          to prepare a representation of their grievances, which report 
          is set down at large in their foregoing Minutes of the 15th of the 
          last month, but as to their petition I have not seen a copy of it. 
          The report setts forth the former petition made to H.M. against 
          me by the Assembly in 1728, which they now repeat again under
          pretence that they did not know that that petition had been 
          preferred to H.M., but they are informed, that it was transmitted to
          <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> in order to be preferred, but miscarryed for 
          want of proper Agents to sollicite the same. I was very much 
          surprised on reading these votes for I thought, it was notoriously 
          known, that it was not only preferr'd, but was order'd by H.M. 
          to be heard by the Lords for Trade etc. together with my answer, 
          and accordingly was heard, and the petition dismissed : but I 
          suppose this repetition of what they could not prove is to be 
          imposed upon the world, as an undoubted proof of the truth of 
          it. I can't help being amazed at their bold assertion in relation 
          to the conduct of the Gentlemen of H.M. Council here, who, 
          they say, " far from making the laws of the land, and the good 
          of their country the rule of their conduct, have acted of late, 
          as if they looked upon themselves indispensibly obliged to 
          concurr with H.E., in every attempt of his upon our liberties, 
          and properties ; " and in their foregoing votes of the 15th 
          of January last, they treat them as incendiaries. But whoever 
          considers the conduct of the Assembly for these three last years 
          in relation to the tax granted to H.M. for supporting the honour 
          and dignity of the Government, as well as by their own votes 
          would be apt to think that they accused the Council of what 
          they were guilty themselves. In their address to me they say 
          that if any deficiencies have happen'd in the collecting the tax, 
          the same " have proceeded from the miserable poverty of the 
          people, who thereby are forced to defend themselves against 
          the rigorous prosecutions, they are daily threatened with " etc. 
          (v. C.S.P. 27th Nov., 1730), and perhaps they may construe 
          any prosecution upon this head, as attempts upon their libertys, 
          and properties ; so that had H.M. Attorney General here prose- 
          cuted every one for H.M. tax who had not paid nor had given 
          in the number of his negro's to his representative or who had 
          not been returned by him a defaulter (for against these the 
          Treasurer by the law is not impower'd to issue his warrant 
          within four months after the time of payment, nor are these 
          persons after the said time discharged of the duty, but only 
          those against whom the law empowers the Treasurer to issue 
          his warrants, which has already been represented to H.M. in 
          the address of the Council) they might have called it a rigorous 
          prosecution, which would be a very absurd construction of the 
          law, as if any one's neglect, or refusal to deliver in the list of his 
          negro's as by the law he is obliged cou'd exempt him from the 
          duty, upon the whole I am most humbly of opinion that if an 
          order was sent to H.M. Attorney General here to sue every body 
          who had not paid their tax for these two last years, and against 
          whom the Treasurer is not empower'd by the law to issue his 
          warrants for the same, after a convenient limited time was 
          allowed them for the payment thereof, I am satisfied the country 
          would be soon quiet, for the people are daily expecting it, and
          say if this be the King's tax, and we ought to pay, how comes 
          it that there is not an order to oblige us to pay. In my letter 
          of 16th Jan. etc., I mentioned an expedient I could have wished 
          the Assembly would have come into, not that H.M. tax could 
          not have been recover'd by due course of law, but out of 
          tenderness to the inhabitants of this Island, for if H.M. Attorney 
          General here was to sue in the Exchequer every body that had 
          not paid his tax the expense of such a prosecution would fall 
          heavy especially on the poor people. Another insinuation in 
          the report is, that Mr. Webster holds the office of Secretary under 
          Francis Whitworth Esq. in trust for me, and therefore I had 
          recommended to the Assembly the fragment of what was due 
          to him, your Grace knows that what I did upon this head was 
          in obedience to H.M. orders in Council, not only for what was 
          due to my Lord Micklethwait and Mr. Whitworth, which was 
          from April 1714 to 1st March, 1726, but also for the future for 
          what ever shall become due to the Secretary for such services 
          as shall be performed by him for the publick. But your Grace 
          will observe by their votes of 19th instant how differently they 
          act in favour of their own officers, they there pass a petition to 
          me unanimously for the payment of 242£. 6s. 7d. for their Clerke, 
          tho' by their Minutes of the 4th Nov., 1729, his salary is settled 
          for the said year at 150£. and 50£. for publishing the votes in 
          the four towns of this Island. By the same annual proportion 
          there should be due to the Clerks of the Council from March, 
          1714 to 26th March, 1729, 3878£. Os. 4d., tho' their accounts 
          come to but 2823£. 16s. 9d. besides 300£., which was paid to Mr. 
          Lenoir a former Deputy Secretary, which would make the whole 
          sum 3123£. 16s. 9d. The report further sets forth, that of all 
          their grievances, that of the encrease of the French trade and 
          power is the greatest, and that it will be proper forthwith to 
          prepare an humble address to his most Gracious Majesty for 
          redress therein, and that accordingly a petition had been 
          presented, but, they say, they know too, that that petition had 
          been opposed at the Board of Trade by me and that my Agent 
          Mr. Sharpe was now opposeing the same ; what I have wrote 
          I thought it was my duty to do, I stated the facts truly, and 
          because Mr. Sharpe transacts my affairs in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>,
          is he to act for nobody else that will employ him ? And as it is notoriously           
          known that he is employed by one of the <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">Northern Colonys</placeName>, 
          a jealous mind might imagine, that this is mentioned to make 
          me odious to the inhabitants. As the Assembly, and they who 
          oppose the payment of H.M. tax have entertained of late great 
          hopes of Mr. Othniel Haggats being a Counsellor, tho' I could 
          say much upon that head, I need only refer your Grace to their 
          own votes by which your Grace will see the part that Gentleman 
          has acted. I dont know any two Gentlemen in the Island, that 
          have been more zealous against the payment of the King's tax, 
          than Mr. Ashley, and he etc. The Guarda da Costa of <placeName ref="#mq" role="direct">Martinico</placeName>
          about a month since went into <placeName ref="#lc_carenage" role="direct">the Carnache</placeName>, a port in
          <placeName ref="#lc" role="indirect">Sta. Lucia</placeName>, where vessells generally resort to carry on a clandestine 
          trade with the French inhabitants of Martinico, and meeting 
          with a great many English vessells, he seized them all, as soon 
          as I was informed of it, I wrote to the Governor of Martinico, 
          that he would restore them, but I have not yet his answer ; 
          however there is a report, that they were condemn'd in the 
          Admiralty Court there, from whence they had appealed to the 
          Governour and Council. I must observe upon this head that 
          some time before this accident happen'd a French Guarda da 
          Costa went in there, and one of the English vessells that were 
          there, fired at her, and lodged a shot in her bow, upon which 
          he return'd to Martinico to make his complaint, and the next 
          day a French man of war was sent thither, but not finding the 
          vessell, which had fired at the Guarda da Costa, he returned 
          without injuring any that were there etc. Encloses duplicate

        <p>Mr. Fane to the Council of Trade and Plantations. 
          In reply to Queries of Jan. 12th, is of opinion (i) that the powers 
          given to the Fishing Admirals and the civil magistrates are 
          entirely distinct ; The Fishing Admirals have no powers but what 
          arise from the Act of the 10th and 11th of K. William III and 
          those confined to the fishing, and the Justices can no more 
          interfere with them in regard to such powers, than the fishing 
          Admirals can interfere with the Justices in the powers given 
          them by their commission, (ii) That the former have no power 
          to send warrants to the constables or commit to prison or the 
          stocks. They are indeed by said Act directed to see that law 
          put in execution, but there is no power to be given by that law 
          to levy penalties or inflict punishments. The want of it, is 
          certainly a defect etc. Thinks the Fishing Admirals are sub- 
          ordinate to the Justices in everything but what relates to their 
          fishing authority, (iii) " I apprehend that aU the statute laws 
          made here previous to H.M. subjects settling in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="direct">Newfoundland</placeName> 
          are in force there : it being a settlement in an infidel country : 
          and as to the laws passed here subsequent to the settlement, 
          I take it they will not extend to this country unless it is particu- 
          larly mentioned, (iv) I do not think the Governour himself 
          can act as Justice of the Peace, for I observe the power from His 
          Majestic is only to appoint fit persons for the administration 
          of Justice." Signed, Fran. Fane. Endorsed, Reed. 30th March,

          upwards of 20 years in <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="direct">Pennsilvania</placeName>
          following husbandry of which they have a perfect understanding.
          Stauber lately took a journey into <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">[? Virgin]ia</placeName>
          on purpose to make a search after some uninhabited land behind 
          <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="indirect">the mountains of that Province</placeName>, which are above 30 miles over,
          and but one place fit for a road. After he had passed these
          mountains with much pains, great difficulty and hazard of life,
          without any company or seeing any Indians in all his travels,
          he spent three months time to view the soyl and situation of
          the land lying westward to the said mountains towards
          <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="indirect">Missisipy river</placeName>, which land he found to be good pasture ground
          fitt for planting of vineyards on the side of the mountains, and 
          a very good soyle for hemp, flax, and all sorts of grain, a proper 
          climate [? to prod]uce silk and a good prospect to make salt 
          petre and potash. Your Lordships are doubtless fully perswaded
          that it will be a great importance to the Crown and 
          interest of the Nation that these Dominions may be enlarged 
          beyond the mountains to the West for the following considerations: 
          If it is neglected to extend the bounds of Great Britain 
          beyond the mountains to the west, it is probable that the French 
          in a short time may take possession thereof. In settling a 
          colony beyond these mountains extending as [? far] as the river 
          of Missisipy, the French settlements of Missisipy and <placeName ref="#ca" role="indirect">Canada</placeName>
          would thereby be prevented to join together, as their intention 
          is, which will be of great prejudice to this Kingdom. The 
          strength of the subjects of this Kingdom in America would be 
          considerably encreased by carrying over a great number of 
          Germans and Swiss Protestants who will be chiefly such as can 
          provide for themselves at [? their own]n charge, which are also 
          reputed to be a good Militia. This colony would be obliged to 
          apply themselves chiefly by reason of the distant land carriage 
          upon such productions as are very much desired in this Kingdom, 
          vizt., hemp, flax, silk, potash, salt petre, with other valuable 
          commodities in which the Germans and Swissers are particularly 
          skilled in (except the silk), the expectation of which commodities 
          from other colonies [? has been] hitherto not answered, it would 
          also considerably augment our trade by consuming a good 
          quantity of the manufacture of this Kingdom, and employ 
          m[?uch ship]ping etc. Pray the Board to recommend the 
          Government to grant them a joint patent of a free grant of a 
          tract of land to begin at the <placeName ref="#mt_doubletop" role="direct">Double Top Mountain</placeName> by
          <placeName ref="#rv_hawksbill" role="direct">Hawks Bill Creek</placeName> including the mountains through which the road 
          is to be made, to go thence northwards in a line to the border 
          of Pensilvania and behind the same, to make the whole breadth 
          200 miles, thence in a straight line to the Missisipy etc. 
          Petitioners undertake the settlement of this colony without 
          any charge to the Government, which hitherto no person has 
          attempted to undertake etc. Will make a road 30 miles long 
          through the mountains, and for security against the Indians 
          will purchase the land and friendship of them with considerable 
          presents etc. " Being so far separated from Virginia, by the 
          mountains 'tis humbly desired that it may be a separate Colony 
          and Government under the [? na]me of Georgia. Stauber, who 
          has employed much time and expences in searching out this 
          land and making a voyage hither, prays for a speedy decision, 
          intending to go without delay to <placeName ref="#de" role="indirect">Germany</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#ch" role="indirect">Switzerland</placeName> to 
          get people to go with them to Virginia etc. Endorsed, Recd.,

          Mr. Popple to Mr. Burchett. Encloses Heads of Enquiry which the Admiralty 
          are desired to give as Instructions to Capt. Waterhouse of H.M.S. Winchelsea
          appointed to guard the Fishery at <placeName ref="#ca_ns_canso" role="direct">Canso</placeName>. Annexed,
          113. i. Heads of Enquiry for Capt. Waterhouse. You are 
          to give all due encouragement and protection to the 
          trade and fishery at Canso, and transmit the fullest 
          account you can get thereof etc., as likewise distinct 
          answers to the following queries, (i) Whether the 
          inhabitants are possessed of any stages, cook-rooms 
          etc. or of any trainfats ? if so, by what title or whether 
          they are left at large for fishing ships ? (ii) Whether 
          any persons do presume to expunge, cut out, deface or 
          alter the mark of any boats or trainfats of other 
          persons and convert them to their own use or remove 
          the same from the places they were left in by the 
          owners ? (iii) By what people is the Fishery carried 
          on ? And whether any strangers or aliens do resort 
          to <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName> or the Islands adjacent thereunto and 
          take bait or use any sort of trade or fishing whatsoever 
          in those parts ? (iv) Whether the said Inhabitants 
          are wholly supplied with sail cloth, nets and tackle for 
          their fishery, and with woollen, linnen, leather and 
          other manufactures, for their use ard wear, from
          <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">this Kingdom</placeName>?
          Or from the Plantations or any foreign 
          country ? (v) What wages do the inhabitants allow 
          to their servants for carrying on the Fishery ? And 
          in what manner do they pay them ? (vi) How much 
          the charge of fitting out and maintaining one of their 
          fishing boats, for the whole season amounts to ? (vii) 
          What number of inhabitants are settled near the coast 
          where the Fishery is carried on ? What share have 
          they in the Fishery ? And how they employ them- 
          selves during the remainder of the year ? (viii) 
          Whether the houses, buildings and inclosures of the 
          inhabitants are at such a distance from the water side 
          as not to hinder or obstruct the fishermen in making 
          their flakes, or in drying and curing their fish ? (ix) 
          How many flakes are allowed to each fishing boat and 
          of what length ? Whether they are extended in length 
          according to the custom used in <placeName ref="#ca_nl" role="secondary">Newfoundland</placeName>
          from the shore up into the land ? Or whether any of the 
          inhabitants or fishermen extend their flakes along 
          shore or possess a larger front to the water side according
          to the number of their boats than was formerly 
          allowed at Newfoundland in that case ? (x) Whether 
          the fishing ships that proceed directly from this 
          Kingdom to Nova Scotia are victualled here and 
          provided with all other necessaries of British product 
          and manufacture for the whole voyage ? Or whether 
          the masters of freighters do not furnish themselves 
          with provisions that are brought from the Plantations 
          or other parts to Nova Scotia ? (xi) Whether any of 
          the fishing ships pursue or follow the old laudable 
          custom of allowing their ships' company shares of 
          what they make in the voyage instead of wages, and 
          in such case how much doth the change of fitting out 
          and maintaining a ship of one hundred with fifty men 
          and ten boats amount to for the whole voyage ? (xii) 
          How many taverns or publick houses for entertainment 
          may there be kept in Nova Scotia or at least in the 
          harbour of Canso ? Are they kept only by the 
          inhabitants or by the people of <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="indirect">New England</placeName>? 
          Also do they trust the fishermen upon their own credit or 
          do the masters of the ships permit them to trust their 
          crews and deduct the same out of their respective 
          wages, hire or shares in order to satisfy the said tavern 
          keepers ? Are not the poor seamen hereby tempted 
          to spend the greatest part or the full amount of their 
          wages, and frequently run so far in debt, that they 
          are forced to remain as servants to the inhabitants, 
          and at last constrain'd to betake themselves to New 
          England ? (xiii) Whether the inhabitants do not 
          usually trust their own servants employ'd in the 
          Fishery with rum and other stores to a greater value 
          than their wages amount to ? And whether they are 
          not generally paid in the manner as in the foregoing 
          article ? (xiv) Whether the New England traders do 
          still continue to entice and carry thither numbers of 
          handicraft men, seamen and fishermen ? And whether 
          any of the inhabitants do favour or assist them therein. 
          Continues : And whereas H.M. Consuls and the merchants residing in 
          <placeName ref="#pt" role="secondary">Portugal</placeName>, <placeName ref="#es" role="secondary">Spain</placeName>
          and <placeName ref="#it" role="secondary">Italy</placeName> unanimously complain,
          that by reason of the ill curing of fish for some years past the consumption thereof is 
          considerably lessen'd and that the trade will be lost 
          if effectual care be not taken to reform the same, you 
          are therefore to use your best endeavours that the 
          masters of the fishing ships and inhabitants do take 
          the greatest care in curing their fish with good salt, 
          and with a sufficient quantity and in preparing, 
          husbanding and ordering the same that the credit 
          thereof may be again recovered and esteemed in the 
          several places for which it is carried for sale. And 
          further upon this occasion you are very particularly 
          to inquire into their manner and method of taking 
          and curing their fish, what quantity of salt they allow 
          for curing 100 quintals ? Whether they are guilty 
          of any abuse in the ordering thereof ? Whether the 
          fish taken at a distance from the land by their small 
          vessels, is not prejudiced before it is brought on shore ? 
          Whether the inhabitants or the fishing ships are most 
          to be blamed ? And in short from whence these 
          complaints arise ? And what methods are to be taken 
          to prevent or rectify whatsoever is amiss ? You are 
          also to enquire into the present state of the French 
          Fishery at Canso and <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="direct">Cape Breton</placeName>, What number of 
          ships, boats and men they employ therein ? Whether 
          they do not encourage Irish Papists who are disaffected 
          to our present happy establishment and what number 
          of such may now be among the French. And to send 
          the best account you can of their strength number and 
          trade. You are farther to enquire whether any of the 
          Officers of the garrison at Canso are concerned directly 
          or indirectly by themselves or others in the Fishery ? 
          Or whether they take upon them to dispose of fishing 
          rooms, beaches, stages etc. to any person whatsoever 
          or hire out the soldiers to fish. Annexed,

          Governor Hunter to the Duke of Newcastle. Refers to letter of March 17. 
          Continues : The elections are not as yet over, but so far as they are gone 
          I think matters are mended. Capt. Dent who is to leave us in ten days will cary with him
          the acts pass'd last session, with the minutes and journals of 
          Council and Assembly. Last Supreme Court in Feb. one 
          William Wood was condemn'd to dye for the murder of Lodwick

          have recommended him as an object of H.M. mercy. I beg 
          that your Grace wou'd be pleas'd to interced that he may be

          comply with it. But the Adventure proving leaky Ld. 
          Muskery desir'd leave to putt the treasure on shoar to lighten 
          the ship, and it was accordingly lodg'd in the Custom-house,

          put again on board notwithstanding the protestations and 
          remonstrances of ye abovenamed gentlemen. Be this true 
          or false I had no share in the advice of sending it that or any

          and take this opportunity of congratulating you upon your safe arrival in

          better settling of the Courts of Justice in South Carolina, passed 
          there by Mr. Middleton in 1726, we take this opportunity of 
          mentioning to you our objections, that you may get another 
          act pass'd not lyable thereto. This Act alters the first process 
          in civil actions from a summons to a capias ; but as in our 
          Law-process, a summons is always suppos'd to be made in the 
          first instance, we think this part of the law ought to be amended 
          and a summons instituted instead of the capias, and the 
          rather, as it will be the least expensive way of proceeding and 
          ye most speedy to obtain justice By another clause in this 
          law we observe the Provost Marshal is obliged to give security 
          for the due performance of his Office ; but as the Provost 
          Marshal seldom resides in Carolina, we think it will be more 
          adviseable to oblige the Deputy to give security, or to mention 
          it in general terms that who ever shall personally execute that 
          office, shall be obliged to give security. As we have no objection 
          to the other parts of this Law, they may be re-enacted again, 
          but you must take care, to insert in the new law a clause to 
          suspend its taking effect till approved by H.M. We hope 
          shortly to receive some account of ye affairs under your 
          managemt. [C.O. 5, 401. pp. 17, 18.]</p>

          Mr. Popple to Capt. Hyde. Since your indisposition 
          prevents your attending the Board etc., I am to send you the
          following queries, and to desire the answer of the several Lessees
          of the <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">Bahama Islands</placeName> thereto as soon as possible,
          (i) What quantities of land are disposed of by the Lessees ? To whom
          and for what term ? (ii) What is the reserv'd rent ? (iii)
          What the Lessees value their lease at ? (iv) What do the
          Lessees annually pay to the Proprietors ? (v) What arrear is
          there of that payment ? [C.O. 24, 1. p. 195.]</p>

          to the queries of the Board of Trade, (i) Lond., 3rd April, 
          1731. The present Lessees have never granted any 
          lands nor given any authorities for granting of lands 
          but by letters, and they have never had any 
          information of any lands having been granted 
          pursuant to those letters, (ii) v. Sept. 9th. (iii) 
          They value their interest at 20,000£., having paid to 
          the old Lessees 20,000£. for the fortifications, and 
          other improvements made by them in, and they having 
          since expended in that work and in sending over 
          inhabitants, provisions and stores 20,000£. more and 
          upwards, and it is apprehended there are several 
          million of acres of land yet unsett. (iv) v. Sept. 9th. 
          (v) 700£. is due to the Lords Proprietors for arrears of 
          rent. N.B. The present Lessees have also expended 
          great sums in dislodging of pirates, defending the 
          islands from the Spaniards, of which accounts have 
          formerly been laid before the Lords Commissioners 
          for Trade, and the great importance these islands are 
          of to the Crown appears in several memorials presented 
          to the late Queen and his late Majesty etc. 1 1/4 pp.

          Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and Plantations.
          Has taken all the care he could to prepare answers to queries. 
          Acknowledges letters of 1st Dec. and 12th Feb. last. 
          Refers to his letters of 7th Oct. and 10th Dec. etc.
          Continues : I am sorry I have occasion to say to your Lordships 
          this new Assembly have still gone backward, and seem resolv'd 
          to do nothing more [as to the Governor's salary] than they did 
          about forty years agoe when the form of government they are 
          now under was first erected, tho' I have left no stone unturn'd 
          to bring them to a sense of their duty. I can't help covering 
          to your Lordships what has been printed <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">here</placeName> out of the Decr. 
          Political State. Who was the vile authour I know not ; the 
          unreasonable ill nature at me is glaring, but I think there is a 
          strong implication of rudeness and ill manners to his most 
          Excellent Majesty and his Ministers, and it has been printed 
          here to poison H.M. subjects as much as possible and has 
          obtain'd the desir'd effect at present so far as to make this 
          Assembly (to use the authour's compliment upon them), more 
          obstinate in their refusal of complying with H.M. Instruction. 
          I think it's a pity but that the authour of the Political State 
          should be punisht according to his demerits. Notwithstanding 
          this villanous libel your Lordships will see by the Journals I 
          inclose (from the last sent you) my Speech to the Assembly, 
          and I still hope. Nothing shall make me swerve from my 
          royal Master's honour and interest. Your Lordships say you 
          should wait my next letters before you make yr. report to 
          H.M. upon this subject, which letters of mine I find were arriv'd 
          before the ships came away by which your Lordships wrote 
          me. I think it my duty to say to your Lordships that I have 
          at present no expectation of this Assembly's doing anything 
          in complyance with H.M. Instruction. They must rise in a 
          few days and I shall then transmit to your Lordships what 
          more may occur, and conformable to the Royal Charter, I shall 
          issue writs for a new Assembly 26 instant and keep your 
          Lordships duly acquainted with all my proceedings. Upon 
          my arrival I directed the King's Secretary to send your 
          Lordships under the seal of the Province at the end of every 
          session all the laws to which I gave my assent and this he tells 
          me he faithfully observes. In your Lordships' letter of 1 
          Deer, you seem to fault me that you had seen the printed 
          votes of the Assembly to that time from another hand, I must 
          ask pardon of your Lordships if I made any slip on this head. 
          I am sure it was not from any want of respect, but rather the 
          contrary, least I should trouble you with too many letters 
          onely to cover the House's Journals de die in diem : But I 
          thought if I sent them at the end of every session, they would 
          be more compleat, and more acceptable to yr. Lordships. Yet 
          if you would have me practice otherwise for the future I shall 
          (on your notice) duly observe it etc. Adds to denial of his 
          intending a military expedition against <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Frederick's Fort</placeName>
          the further confirmation that he did not keep or demolish it when 
          Hamilton, who called himself Col. Dunbar's Lieutenant, upon 
          sight of the King's Sheriffe (with his posse) deserted the fort, 
          and ran into the woods like a lusty fellow etc. Begs to be served 
          with a copy of any complaint before proceedings are taken 
          upon it etc. P.S. I should take it as a favour for the future, 
          that your Lordships would commit the care of your letters for 
          me to Francis Wilks Esq., they will always then come to me in 
          great safety. Signed, J. Belcher. Endorsed, Recd. 21st May,

        <p>Extract from the Political State of Great Britain for 
          the month of December, 1730. Abstract : The people 
          of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">Massachusetts Bay</placeName> continue in their refusal of 
          complying with H.M. Instructions for appointing a 
          fixed salary upon their Governors. Governor Belcher 
          insists as strongly as ever any Governor did upon 
          their complying, although he was formerly positive 
          against it and was the person sent over by them to 
          oppose any measures for such a settlement etc. Most 
          of the Council it seems think differently for the 
          Assembly. Quotes Governor's Speech to Council and 
          Assembly 2nd Oct., 1730 ; urging a settlement, 
          quoting the Board of Trade's report on the subject 
          in 1723, and reminding them that their disputes with 
          the Crown have already cost them over 50,000£. 
          From his experience as Agent assures them that 
          nothing prevented a Parliamentary proceeding against 
          them last winter, but the King being willing to give 
          them one more opportunity to show their duty and 
          gratitude by doing what is so just and reasonable. 
          Has the strongest persons to fear that they have " so 
          few friends among the King's Ministers, or in either 
          House of Parliament, as that a proceeding in a way 
          the King says, your final non-compliance must bring 
          it to, will bring into the utmost hazard every thing 
          that is dear to the people of this country " etc. Quotes 
          letters from Mr. Belcher and Mr. Wilks, Oct. 24, 1729 
          and 1st May, 1730, and Governor Belcher's Speech 
          to the Representatives, 16th Oct., 1730. The author 
          concludes : I am perswaded that these Gentlemen 
          of the House of Representatives, who are so resolute 
          against the commands of the Crown, have the honour 
          and interest of their native country, and the liberties 
          and properties of those they represent nearly at heart, 
          otherwise they would never make such a stand against 
          Royal Power, which has now so many ways of 
          rewarding its humble servants, and so large a scope 
          for punishing its opposers etc. The Assembly resembles 
          our Parliaments in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, the Governor represents 
          the King and the Council the Lords, and every member 
          of our Parliament would hear with disdain the threats 
          and expressions in Governor Belcher's Speech and 
          Message, " terms more proper for a French 
          Monarch, or a Turkish Bashaw than for an English 
          Governor " etc. As His Majesty "is so gracious, 
          that he ever desired to be independent of his 
          Parliament, I cannot think that he ever desired 
          that any of his Governors should be independent of 
          the people, they are sent to rule over. . . I am 
          perswaded that his Majesty has so great a regard for 
          the liberties of his people, that he will not give the least 
          handle for oppressing them in any part of his Dominions, 
          nor be disobliged by any man who delivers his 
          sentiments bravely and freely " etc. When any King 
          allows himself to be lulled asleep by putting a stop to 
          informations through the liberty of speech and the 
          Press, he is in danger of being himself involved in a 
          ruin, which was at first only designed against his 
          Ministers. Nor is a standing army of any effect in 
          such circumstances. The dispute in <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="indirect">New England</placeName> 
          is of the more weight, because it is one of the best and 
          most powerful Colonies we have in the <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="secondary">West Indies</placeName>. 
          Oppression and arbitrary sway generally take their 
          rise in the most remote parts of a nation. For that 
          reason, he is particularly interested in New England, 
          " because I am afraid it should one time or other serve 
          as a precedent at Home." Enclosed, Recd. 31st May, 1731. Printed. 16 pp.</p>

          <placeName ref="#us_nh_portsmouth" role="from">Portsmouth, N.H.</placeName>, 25th March, 1731. 
          i-iii Describes situation, boundaries and constitution. 
          (iv) The Trade is lumber and fish. The number of 
          shipping belonging to the Province are five consisting 
          of about 500 tons, and there are about 3 or 400 tons 
          of other shipping that trade here annually. Seafaring 
          men, about 40. The trade is much the same as it 
          hath been for ten years past. (v) The Province 
          makes use of all sorts of Brittish manufactures, 
          amounting to about 5000£. sterling pr. annum, which 
          are had principally from <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName>. (vi) The trade to 
          other Plantations is to the <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="indirect">Caribbee Islands</placeName>, whither 
          we send lumber and fish, and receive for it rum, sugar, 
          molasses and cotton. The trade to <placeName ref="#europe" role="indirect">Europe</placeName>, is to 
          <placeName ref="#es" role="secondary">Spain</placeName> or <placeName ref="#pt" role="secondary">Portugal</placeName>
          in the above mentioned commodities, from whence our vessels bring home salt, (vii) The 
          method appointed to prevent illegal trade is by a 
          Collector appointed at home, (viii) The natural 
          produce is timber, principally oak, pine, hemlock, 
          ash, beech and birch and fish, and they are the only 
          commodities of the place. The timber is generally 
          manufactur'd into beams, plank, knees, boards, 
          clap-boards, shingle and staves, and sometimes into 
          house-frames ; the value annually exported to Europe 
          and the West India Islands, is about 1000£. sterling. 
          Mem. Besides what is above mentioned, the coasting 
          sloops from Boston carry from hence thither in fish 
          and timber about 5000£. per annum, (ix) No mines 
          yet discovered except a small quantity of iron ore in 
          two or three places, (x) Inhabitants, about 10,000 
          whites and 200 blacks, (xi) They are increased about 
          4000 this ten years last past, 1000 of which (at least) 
          are people from <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName> lately come into and settled 
          in the Province. Another reason of the increase of 
          late more than formerly, is a peace with the Indians 
          the four last years, (xii) The Militia, about 1800, 
          consists of two regiments of foot with a troop of horse 
          in each, (xiii) There is one fort or place of defence 
          called <placeName ref="#us_nh_williammary" role="direct">Fort William and Mary</placeName>, situate on
          <placeName ref="#is_newcastle" role="direct">the great island in Newcastle</placeName>, which commands the entrance of 
          <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="direct">Piscataqua river</placeName>, but is in poor low circumstances, 
          much out of repair, and greatly wanting stores of war, 
          there not being one barrel of gunpowder at this time 
          there, (xiv) There are no Indians in this Province 
          now in time of peace (xv), nor in the neighbourhood, except in 
          <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">the Eastern parts of the Massachusetts Bay</placeName>,
          and their number and strength we are not

          and <placeName ref="#ca_ns_cb" role="indirect">Cape Briton</placeName> etc. (xvii) The effect which the 
          French settlements have on this Province is, that 
          the Indians are frequently instigated and influenced 
          by them to disturb the peace and quiet of this Province, 
          we having been often put to a vast expence both of 
          blood and treasure to defend ourselves against their 
          outrages, (xviii) The revenue is 396£ by excise, 
          which is appropriated towards the Governor's salary, 
          and three or four barrels of gunpowder from the 
          shipping, which is spent at the Fort, there is no other 
          revenue but by tax on polls and estates. (xix) 
          Ordinary expense of the Government is about 1500£. 
          etc. Extraordinary and contingent charges as repairs 
          of the Fort, powder etc. about 500£. more. (xx) The 
          establishments are 600£. salary on the Governor, 8s. 
          per diem on each Councillor, and 6s. per diem on each 
          Representative during the session of General Assembly, 
          and 150£. per annum on the officers and soldiers at the 
          Fort. There is no other establishment, civil or 
          military, but the Assembly make allowances from 
          time to time as they see meet to the Treasurer, 
          Secretary etc. The Judges, Justices, Sheriffs, Clerks 
          and all other officers fees are fix'd by a law to be paid 
          by the parties whom they serve, but they have nothing 
          out of the Treasury. All the officers, civil and military, 
          hold their places by commission from the Governor 
          except the Councillors appointed by the King, the 
          Recorder of deeds chosen by the General Assembly, 
          the Clerks of Courts nominated by the Judges of the 
          said Courts respectively, and select men, assessors, 
          constables, tithing men and other town officers chosen 
          by the towns at their respective town meetings.

        <p>Sir William Keith to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. I have in obedience to your Lordships' commands 
          examined the above etc., and I am humbly of opinion, that 
          H.M. may be advised to pass such a grant etc. (i) Because 
          until some such settlement be actually made by a numerous 
          active people from behind <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="direct">the Great Mountains</placeName> all along to 
          the <placeName ref="#rv_mississippi" role="direct">River Messussippi</placeName>,
          I conceive it will be impossible to prevent 
          foreigners from setling those rich lands in the middle of
          <placeName ref="#n_america" role="indirect">the Continent</placeName> which undoubtedly belong to the Crown of Britain 
          and the possession whereof are absolutely necessary to secure 
          and defend from future danger the valuable colonies already 
          setled on the coast and on this side the mountains, (ii) Because 
          such an improvement or inlet to a trade with the numerous native 
          Indians on <placeName ref="#lk_great" role="indirect">the Lakes</placeName> and the branches of the Messussippi will 
          give a new and large vent to the exportation of course woolings 
          and other British manufactures fit for the traffick which is 
          continually decaying at present in all the Colonies on this side
          the mountains, the game there being wasted and the Indians 
          reduced to a very small number. (iii) Because when this 
          Colony is settled etc., it will infallibly raise the vast tracts of 
          lands on each side as far West as the banks of the Messussippi 
          to a considerable value which without such a settlement can 
          never be of any use to the Crown of Britain, but on the contrary 
          will be a prey to foreigners and a continual annoyance to the 
          Colonies on this side the mountains, (iv) Because the European 
          market etc. seems to be overcharged with the present product 
          of our Colonies on the main such as tobacco, rice, corn etc. 
          which forces the people into trifling manufactures of their own, 
          and discourages or lessens the exportations from Great Britain, 
          whereas by the settlement proposed where the people can have 
          no access to navigation a new scene is open'd for the produce 
          of silk, hemp, flax, potash, wines etc. ; besides the vast extent 
          of Indian trade already mention'd. (v) Because there is no prospect of ever making such a settlement 
          by slow degrees with such a handfull of people as can be spared 
          at any one time from <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName> or
          <placeName ref="#ie" role="indirect">Ireland</placeName>, and therefore it is adviseable by such 
          a grant as this to tempt or induce a large body of foreigners to 
          bring over their effects and subject themselves in this manner 
          to the Dominion of Britain, under which no doubt they will 
          rejoyce to feel the happy effects of a resonable freedom, (vi) 
          Because this settlement and the improvment of the lands being 
          to be carried on at the general expence of the setlers themselves 
          and not out of the estates of the persons to be named in the 
          patent, the success will probably depend on its being evidently 
          the interest of the patentees to invite the setlers on much easier 
          terms than would in all likelihood be obtain'd from persons of 
          overgrown estates and opulent fortunes, for it is a certain truth 
          that where large quantitys of land in America have fallen into 
          the hands of such proprietors they have been rarely sought 
          after and commonly very slow in improvement besides persons 
          of a low degree in life who are known amongst their equals to 
          be morally honest and industrious will sooner perswade a 
          multitude into a voluntary expedition of this nature than those 
          of greater wealth and higher rank who are ever liable to the 
          suspicion and jealousy of the vulgar, (vii) Because let the 
          patentees in such a case be men of what condition or estate you 
          please, the only security which the Crown can depend on is a 
          limitation in the patent that the lands shall actually be setled 
          in a certain time or the grant shall be void and from the nature 
          and scituation of the place proposed if 100 familys once sit 
          down there will be no room to apprehend any loss or ill 
          consequences from such a beginning. (viii) Because if this 
          proposition should be rejected at this time, it is uncertain 
          whether an application of the like nature made by foreigners 
          to the Court of <placeName ref="#fr" role="secondary">France</placeName> would not readily be accepted perhaps 
          on terms not very agreeable to the interest of Great Britain.

          your Grace with what I wrote to him about recruiting. If that 
          or some such method be not taken, the Regiments will in time

          Governor Hunter to the Council of Trade and Plantations.
          Encloses duplicate of 11th Feb. etc. Continues: 
          The several resolutions of the Assembly in the said letter 
          mention'd have since that been pass'd into four acts, transmitted 
          herewith, vizt. : (i) An act for raising several sums of money 
          and applying the same to several uses. This act is commonly 
          call'd the Additional duty bill and varies little in substance 
          from the annual bills which usually passes under the same 
          title, only in this particular, that they have rais'd the duty 
          upon the import, and export of negroes from ten shillings pr. 
          head to fifteen in the former, and from twenty shillings pr. 
          head to thirty on the latter, (ii) An act for raising a tax by the 
          poll, and on trades, offices and rents. In this act 12d. per head 
          is laid upon every negro and 3d. pr. head upon all cattle, horses, 
          mares, asses and mules, and the trades, offices and rents are 
          taxed as usual. It is computed that this bill will raise about 
          6000£., and it is appropriated intirely for an additional sub- 
          sistance to the officers and soldiers of H.M. two Regiments, 
          (iii) An act to oblige the several inhabitants to provide themselves 
          with sufficient number of white people, or pay certain sums of money 
          in case they shall be deficient, and for laying a duty upon shipping 
          the same to several uses. This act is what is commonly call'd 
          our Deficiency bill, and the deficiency being 26£. the same as 
          last year, it is believed the inhabitants will rather chuse to keep 
          their complement of white men and women than pay so high 
          a tax ; if so this bill will raise but little money. The duty 
          upon shipping has been inserted in former bills, but generally 
          appropriated to the repairing the walls at <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName>;
          in this bill it is given as well as the deficiency for an additional
          subsistence to the two Independent Companys, and the 
          overplus (if any) to such other uses as the Assembly shall direct, 
          (iv) An act for appropriating and applying money for the 
          additional subsistence of the officers and soldiers of the two regiments 
          arrived and for other uses, and ascertaining the voluntary rewards 
          to be allowed for the services they perform, and to oblige such parishes 
          as have not already made up their accompts and paid their arrears 
          to do the same in a prefixed time. This act appropriates all the 
          money arising by the three acts abovemention'd and not already 
          appropriated for and towards an additional subsistence to the 
          two Regiments etc., each Commissioned Officer resident on the 
          Island 20s. pr. week, to each private man 5s. pr. week, the 
          Officers' pay to commence from the day of their landing here, 
          and the private men's to take place so soon as the King's 
          provisions they brought with them should be expended, the 
          additional subsistance to continue only for six months and no 
          longer, tho' the fund be for one whole year this bill ; this bill 
          also obliges the parishes where the troops are or shall be sent 
          to provide good and convenient barracks, and allotts 12 negroes 
          to attend each company to be allow'd and paid for by the 
          Church Wardens of such parishes where the troops are quartered, 
          and a reward of 10£. is given for each rebellious negro the soldiers 
          shall either kill or take alive ; there is also in this bill two small 
          appropriations of 150£. and 100£. which the publick stood 
          engaged for, and the Council making no objections to this bill 
          nor the other three, I gave my consent to them, and finding the 
          Assembly not in a disposition to enter upon any other business 
          I did at their own request grant them a recess. On 2nd March 
          I summon'd a Council who gave it as their unanimous opinion 
          that the Assembly should be dissolved, which [I] did accordingly 
          by proclamation ; the chief motives which induced me to joyn 
          in opinion with them are, that this Assembly had already sat 
          three years, that in this last session great heats and disputes 
          arose about allowing an additional subsistance to the troops, 
          in so much that it was all that the friends of the Government 
          could obtain in the House to provide for them for six months 
          to which the words "and no longer" were added, and tho' I had 
          so often recommended to this Assembly several very material 
          things for the wellfare of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Country</placeName>, such as the better settling 
          the uncultivated lands, and giving due encouragement to white 
          people to become inhabitants, and to consider on some proper 
          measures to regain credit (now almost at a stop) and to establish 
          the value of our coin, yet they neglected doing any thing upon 
          those heads, tho' apparently for their own good. The merchants 
          began to be uneasie, and as I am credibly inform'd wish'd for 
          a disolution, so that I acquiest in giving the country a new 
          choice. Writts were accordingly issued for calling a new 
          Assembly to meet on the fourth of May, and the elections are 
          just over and by what I can guess I hope we shall have a better 
          disposed Assembly, there are more merchants in it than in the 
          last and about one half are new Members, tho' several of the 
          old who were there before meerly for protection have by their 
          industry got in again, etc. Encloses Minutes of Council to 9th 
          March, and Journals of the Council and of the late Assembly, 
          " but as there is nothing of great moment in them, I shall not 
          trouble your Lordships with any particular observations." 
          Continues : The troops are gone to the several parishes to be 
          barrack'd as the Act directs, and I hope in a short time they 
          will be better reconciled to their quarters, the Gentlemen of 
          fortune in the Island being very kind to them. They write me 
          from <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, where Admiral Stewart now is,
          that all the troops there are in perfect health, and considering the infancy 
          of that settlement pritty well accommodated. Since Capt. 
          Peters's party who burnt the negro town were disbanded, the 
          rebellious slaves have made incurtions upon some of the out 
          settlements which makes me believe that they are dispersing 
          themselves into small bodys. I shall take all possible care to 
          make the troops usefull and to encourage the country voluntary 
          partys to pursue them. By the last advices from <placeName ref="#pa_portobello" role="direct">Porto Bello</placeName>
          we have an account that the Fair was to begin about the latter 
          end of this month, that there was a great deal of money already 
          arrived from <placeName ref="#pe_lima" role="indirect">Lima</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#pa" role="indirect">Panama</placeName> and more hourly expected, 
          and that it was generally believed the cargo of the <placeName ref="#pacific" role="secondary">South Sea</placeName>
          ship Prince William would come to a very great market, etc.

          Governor Belcher to the Duke of Newcastle. It is his 
          duty and honour to acquaint his Grace with the affairs of 
          his Government. Hopes that his letters of Jan. 23 will acquit 
          him from Col. Dunbar's false complaint. Col. Dunbar's Lieut. 
          having deserted <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">the fort</placeName> (v. Jan. 11 no. 6, encl. :)
          the Sheriff went into it and siezed the robbers he was in quest of, so, "had I 
          had any design on the fort, I might have kept or demolisht it." 
          Begs for a line from his Grace in his justification etc. Continues :
          Notwithstanding Collo. Dunbar's vile representation of me 
          I hear by the late ships from <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName> he is appointed my Lieut. 
          Govr. in <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, this I can scarce believe and would 
          humbly pray of your Grace it may not be so. For how is it 
          possible, My Lord Duke, that the King's service and the good 
          of that Province can be carry'd an end with tolerable quiet, and 
          satisfaction while I must have an officer under me diametrically 
          opposite to me. Let me therefore once more beg it of your 
          Grace as a singular favour, that Collo. Sherburn (whom I formerly 
          mention'd) may be my Lieut. Govr. in New Hampshire etc. 
          Continues : I dissolv'd the Assembly of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">this Province</placeName> the 24th 
          currant after a session of upwards ten weeks, and have issued 
          writs for a new one to be held 26th of next month, in conformity 
          to the Royal Charter, and I now inclose to your Grace the votes 
          of the Assembly from my last to the compleating of this session, 
          by which it will be seen that the Assembly has done nothing in 
          complyance with the King's Instruction either as to fixing a 
          salary on H.M. Govr. or paying the arrearages so justly due to 
          their late Govr.'s children. As to the latter I have no 
          expectation of the Assembly of this Province paying those 
          poor orphans one farthing altho' they had voted the late Govr. 
          Burnett 6000£ a few days before his death, yet now they are 
          not willing to pay what was due to that time being 3400£. As 
          to the fixing a salary etc., I have no reason to think they will 
          ever do anything further or nearer to it than the bill transmitted 
          Dec. 10th past etc. Continues : Yet might I have the royal 
          leave to sign such a bill I should not doubt it's being a good 
          security for the Govr.'s support. I would therefore humbly 
          pray of your Grace that I might have the King's leave to receive 
          my support in that manner, or some other way that the King 
          may think proper. For with great deference to your Grace I 
          believe it will not be thought reasonable that I must go on to 
          support the King's honour in the character of his Govr. at the 
          expence of my own estate. I can assure your Grace that it's 
          not possible to live in any tolerable figure as the King's Govr. 
          with what H.M. has so moderately requir'd of this Province 
          for a salary to his Govr. and was it fixt agreeable to the King's 
          Instruction, no gentn. with the best husbandry could lay up 
          one farthing at the year's end. I am told the House of Repre- 
          sentatives are addressing H.M. to take off the force of several 
          of his royal Instructions to me. I hope your Grace will give 
          no countenance to an attempt of this nature till I am serv'd 
          with a copy of the said Address or Memorial, that I may make 
          a return to your Grace, and say how far the granting what they 
          are desiring might affect the honour and interest of the Crown, 
          and upon receiving your Grace's commands in this matter, I 
          shall with the greatest fidelity to H.M. return my answer to 
          your Grace etc. I am surpriz'd at the assurance of the House 
          of Representatives to be asking favours of the King, while they
          will not pay the least decent or dutifull respect to his orders. 
          But they are daily endeavoring to incroach upon the little 
          power reserv'd to the Crown in the Royal Charter, of which 
          your Grace may be assur'd I will part with none without my 
          royal Master's orders. I think they have too much already 
          unless they us'd it with more good manners to the King, and 
          more to the benefit of their countrey. Signed, J. Belcher.

          The inhabitants of the <placeName ref="#bm" role="direct">Bermuda Islands</placeName> are the 
          only people concerned in the whale fishery there, and they 
          have not hitherto made any objection to the paying for licences 
          on this accompt to their Governor. But notwithstanding this, 
          if your Lordships should be of opinion that this Instruction 
          lately given for preventing the Governor from granting licences 
          shou'd still continue in force in Bermuda since the benefit 
          thereof will wholly result to the inhabitants of those islands, 
          it would seem reasonable that they should make the Governour 
          some satisfaction for it, and that he should be instructed to
          recommend in H.M. name to the Assembly of Bermuda, that 
          they do take the proper means for raising and paying an 
          adequate salary to him in lieu thereof not exceeding the annual 
          sum of 100£., because the whale licences have always been 
          computed to him as part of his salary to that value. [C.O. 38, 8. pp. 156-158.]</p>

        <p>Petition of John Yeamans, Agent of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> to the 
          Council of Trade and Plantations. There is a standing 
          instruction, that in the absence of the Capt. General of the 
          <placeName ref="#leeward" role="direct">Leeward Islands</placeName>, the Lt.-General shall have the chief command, 
          and in his absence the Lt. Govr. of <placeName ref="#nevis" role="direct">Nevis</placeName>, and in his absence 
          the President of the Councill there. It may be of ill consequence 
          to oblige the Lt. Governor of the other islands to receive their 
          orders from the Lt. Governor or President in Nevis, not only 
          on account of the inferior rank and value that island holds 
          among the rest, but also because it is situated to the leeward 
          of Antigua and <placeName ref="#ms" role="indirect">Montserrat</placeName>. There has been no person at the 
          head of Nevis for several years resident there bearing H.M. 
          Commission. As the Lt. General is in a few days expected in 
          <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName>, the chief command must devolve on the President 
          of Nevis etc. Antigua is generally esteemed the most considerable
          of the Leeward Islands on account of its produce, and is 
          by reason of its strength, situation and the convenience of its 
          harbours, of much more consequence to the Crown than either 
          of the rest. It lies to windward of all the rest, and in case of 
          any attempt from an enemy, orders may be dispatched and 
          succours from thence landed in a night's time, in any of the 
          other islands, which could not without great difficulty and 
          length of time be dispatched from either of the said islands to 
          Antigua, because the vessels that carry them must ply to 
          windward, and run the risque of being intercepted by an enemy. 
          'Tis owing to these advantages, as memorialist concieves, that 
          the Capt. General is obliged by his Instructions to reside in 
          Antigua nine months in the year ; that it has always been 
          thought necessary to keep the greatest part of H.M. forces 
          there, and that this is the station appointed for the King's 
          ships of warr, unless when the service requires they should be 
          out upon the cruize. It seems where the greatest strength is etc. 
          Prays that the Lt. Governor of Antigua may be appointed to 
          command in chief in the absence of the Capt. and Lt. General 
          etc. Endorsed, Recd. 17th, Read 21st May, 1731. 2 1/3 pp.

          for amending the staple of tobacco etc. Quote views of Mr. Fane, 
          Lt. Gov. Gooch, and the Commissioners of Customs, and 
          the Agent for Virignia. (v. supra.) The most considerable 
          merchants in the tobacco trade concurred with the Lt. Govr. 
          and Agent of Virginia in desiring that the act might be confirmed. 
          Continue :--We are obliged however to take notice to your 
          Majesty, that some time since a law of this kind, which had 
          been in force about three years, was repealed at the desire of 
          the merchts., which in many particulars bore a very near 
          resemblance to the act in question, tho' they now seem to have 
          altered their opinion upon that subject, yet since the 
          Commissrs. of the Customs do apprehend that this act may be 
          prejudicial to your Majesty's revenue at home, we could not 
          advise the immediate confirmation of it. But, considering that 
          this act is calculated to recover the credit of so important a 
          staple as that of tobacco, considering it contains many clauses 
          well intended for the prevention of frauds, and that your 
          Majesty's quit-rents and the duty of 2s. upon every hogshead 
          of tobacco in Virginia may be thereby improved, because the 
          same will for the future be paid in better tobacco than formerly ; 
          we are humbly of opinion that your Majesty may be pleased 
          to suffer this act to lye by probationary, until the effects of it 
          may be seen. This being a temporary law, will of itself expire 
          in four years, but, by the method we humbly propose, it will be 
          always in your Majesty's power to repeal the same within that 
          term, if it shall be found prejudicial to your Majesty's revenue, 
          or to the trade of your subjects. [C.O. 5, 1366. pp. 61-71.]</p>

          Order of Committee of Privy Council. Referring enclosed memorial
          to the Council of Trade and Plantations for their report.
          Signed, W. Cary. Endorsed, Recd. 21st May, Read 8th June, 1731. 3/4 p. Enclosed, 
          188. i. Petition of Thomas Beake, Agent for <placeName ref="#stchristophers" role="direct">St. Christophers</placeName>, 
          to the King in Council. The Legislature of said island 
          finding that the fees in the Court of Chancery were 
          very grievous, and that some of them had a law for 
          their sanction and that in other the Secretary had 
          bound himself by no rule but his own will, and that in 
          several other branches of his office, and particularly 
          in the Ordinaries he had raised his own fees and the 
          Governor's to near the double of what they are settled 
          at by law, and Wavell Smith the Secretary having 
          of late set no bounds to his fees, occasioned a generall 
          dissatisfaction and outcry among the people, and some 
          instances of it happening to appear in proof before the 
          Assembly, when the Chief Justice and Mr. Smith were 
          heard at the barr of their house upon a contest between 
          them, and the Assembly being then upon a bill for 
          regulating fees they thought it proper to enquire into 
          the Secretary's fees and to redress any grievance that 
          might arise therefrom. To this end on 19th Dec. 
          1729 the Assembly appointed a Committee to enquire 
          what fees were then taken by the Officers attending 
          the Courts of Justice etc., with power to send for 
          persons, papers and records. Mr. Smith allarmed at 
          such an order and well knowing his actions would not 
          bear examination, when the Committee summoned 
          him and his deputy to attend with an account of such 
          fees, himself refused to attend, and sent his Deputy 
          with an account only of what fees he took in the Courts 
          of King's Bench and Common Pleas, and of no other 
          fees in his other offices etc. On 30th Dec. therefore 
          it was resolved by the House that he was guilty of an 
          act of disobedience to its authority, but deferred 
          passing any censure upon him, to see whether he would 
          make any excuse and produce his docquett of fees and 
          offer himself to be examined thereupon etc. But in 
          defiance and contempt of the House, he went off to 
          <placeName ref="#ag" role="indirect">Antigua</placeName>, whereby it was evident he refused to comply 
          with the orders of the House etc. Whereupon the 
          House addressed the Governor to suspend him from 
          the Council until H.M. pleasure should be known,           
          (21st April). The Council on the same day resolved 
          that his refusing to attend the Committee in order to 
          his being examined was a great contempt and indignity 
          offered to that House, and that such his refusall was 
          a presumptious offence. They also advised the 
          Commander in Chief to send a copy of the Assembly's 
          address and their resolve to Mr. Smith requiring him 
          to send immediately a satisfactory answer, in default 
          whereof they then advised his Honour to suspend him 
          from his office as Councillor. Mr. Smith sent (19th 
          May) an answer upon which the House resolved that 
          it was untrue and evasive and reflecting on the honour 
          and justice of the House and in a conference with the 
          Council resolved to request his Honour to suspend 
          Mr. Smith. Prays that H.M. will remove him from the Council etc.

          191. i. Petition of George Phenney, late Governor of
          <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">Bahama Islands</placeName>, to the King. Prays to be relieved
          from the bond into which the Assembly compelled him to enter 
          for repayment of the sums levied during his administration. 
          The money never came into his hands, but 
          was applied solely to the public service with the 
          consent and advice of the Council. Petitioner with 
          great assiduity repaired the forts etc. He was obliged 
          to build two large sloops to fetch provisions for the 
          garrison, which being cast away, he lost upwards of 
          800£. Prays for an allowance for his expences and losses etc.

          petitioner and his clerks etc. Concludes : Petitioner 
          has faithfully served the Crown, under the Commission 
          of Trade above 16 years, 9 as Secretary etc. And 
          forasmuch as Petitioner and his clerks have no other 
          advantage from their places than their salarys, (so 
          long as these gratuitys are suspended) which salarys 
          are not a sufficient subsistence for the said Clerks, and 
          after the usuall deductions but a very moderate 
          maintenance for your petitioner and his family, prays 
          that annexed schedule of fees may be approved etc.

          " as the most direct way of it's coming to the Royal presence. 
          If I err in the manner I humbly ask your Grace's pardon." 
          Continues : So soon as the Committee shall have prepared 
          the representation of the state of this country, I shall transmit 
          it unto your Grace, and to the Lords Commrs. of Trade 
          etc. pursuant to the directions of the Assembly. In the mean 
          time I ask liberty to assure your Grace, that I find in the people 
          of this province a most hearty zeal and affection for H.M. person 
          and Government, and a readiness to comply with all H.M, 
          Instructions to the utmost of their power, which I trust will be 
          very evident to your Grace when you shall see the Journal of 
          the Assembly. I am preparing a large map of this province 
          for H.M. view, drawn from several observations I collected 
          when I was Surveyor Genll, of this Province and many helps 
          I have received from several gentlemen of this and the neigh- 
          bouring Governments, the particulars whereof shall com- 
          municate to your Grace when I send the map, etc. Signed,

          to the King. We etc. with chearfulness lay hold of 
          this opportunity on our first meeting after the publication
          of your Majesty's purchase of the sovereignty 
          of this Province ; to acknowledge with the profoundest 
          gratitude the many blessings we enjoy under your 
          auspicious and happy reign. It is with the greatest 
          pleasure we observe your Majesty and our gracious 
          Queen Caroline always intent on promoting the 
          happiness of all your people ; and altho' we are so 
          remote from your Royal presence, we find ourselves 
          nevertheless assured of your fatherly care and concern.
          We are in duty bound to acknowledge as a 
          particular mark of your indulgence, the placing 
          over us H. E. George Burrington Esq. etc., who by 
          his behaviour during the time he governed this 
          Province for the Lords Proprietors rendred himself 
          very agreable to the people by the great care he then 
          shewed in his due administration of Justice, and in 
          promoting the wellfare of this Province ; on which 
          occasion his indefatigable industry and the hardships 
          he underwent in carrying on the settlement at  
          <placeName ref="#us_nc_capefear" role="direct">Cape Fear</placeName> deserves our thankful remembrance.
          The Governor having laid before us several of your 
          Majesty's Instructions relating to this Province, we 
          think it our duty thankfully to acknowledge your 
          Majesty's great clemency and goodness expressed in 
          those Instructions toward the people of this your 
          Province ; and as some of them do necessarily require 
          that your Majesty should be informed of the state 
          and condition of this country, we have directed a 
          Committee to transmit a true state thereof. Pray for 
          H.M. long reign and the succession of the House of Hanover.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Lt. Governor 
          Gooch. Acknowledges letters etc. of 29th June and 7th Sept., 
          1729, 9th Jan., 9th April, 29th May, 23rd July and 14th 
          Sept., 1730, and 12th and 27th Feb., 1731. Continue: 
          We commend your punctuality in corresponding with us, 
          and we should not have been wanting in proper returns to 
          you, but the subject matter of most of the above-mentioned 
          letters related principally to your scheme for improving the 
          staple of tobacco, and the law which you pass'd in consequence 
          of it, which being matters of very great consequence, required 
          a very mature consideration, and it is but very lately that we 
          have been able to come to any determination concerning them, 
          wherefore we chose to defer writing to you, till we could give 
          you some account of them in our letter. Upon considering 
          this law, we thought it for H.M. service, and for the service of 
          all those who are concern'd in the trade to <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName>,
          to receive the different opinions of such persons as might give us any 
          further light into this matter ; and as we have met with some 
          who were very sanguine for the confirmation of this act, and 
          some as sanguine for the repeal of it, we have chose the midway,
          and have offer'd our opinion to H.M. that the same may lye 
          by probationary, in order to try the good effects you expect 
          may result from it ; As the pressing instances you have made, 
          and the many reasons you have offer'd to us in behalf of this 
          act, have greatly weigh'd with us in our resolution concerning 
          the same, we think it the more incumbent upon you, supposing 
          H.M. should be graciously pleased to confirm our report, to 
          have a watchfull eye over the persons who are to put this act 
          in execution, that no partiality be shewn to any person, and 
          thereby bad tobacco exported from your Colony ; For we 
          must upon this occasion remind you, that an act of this nature 
          was pass'd in 1713, and after some years experience was repealed 
          in 1717, at the desire of all the Virginia merchts., who did 
          assure the then Board of Trade, that the Agents, who by that 
          act were the same officers, and had the same duty as those who 
          by this are called inspectors, did permit as much trash tobacco, 
          to be exported as before the passing that act. This was one of 
          the reasons why we did not propose your law to be confirm'd, 
          and because we shall now have it in our power to advise the 
          King to repeal the same, as we certainly shall do, if we find by 
          experience that this act does not answer the intent of its passing, 
          better than the other law did, in which case the Colony 
          of Virginia will have been put to a very great expence to no 
          purpose ; we must therefore repeat once more, that it is the 
          more incumbent upon you to take great care of the execution 
          of this law, since you have been so very pressing for its 
          confirmation. We have recommended Col. Harrison to be of 
          the Council etc., and he has been appointed accordingly. It 
          was not possible for us to comply with your request in favour 
          of Mr. Armistead, having been for some time before engag'd 
          to recommend Col. Bray, as we have now done in the room of 
          Mr. Page. We are glad to find that you have at last brought 
          the negroes to a quiet submission, and we hope that by your 
          prudent management they may be kept so for the future. 
          Your letter of 14th Dec. last, wherein, you say, you gave us 
          an account of the insurrection of the negroes, never came to 
          our hands. [C.O. 5, 1366. pp. 71-74.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. 
          Representation upon Act of <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName>, 1728,
          to supply the defects of an act for constituting a Court of Chancery etc. There 
          are many provisions in this Act for regulating the proceedings 
          of the Court of Chancery in Antigua, and for supplying some 
          defects in a former act referr'd to in the title. But the main 
          purport of the act, is to enable the Lieut. General in the absence 
          of your Majesty's Capt. General, the Lieut. Govr. of Antigua, 
          in their absence, and the President of the Council, in the absence 
          of the other three Officers aforesaid, to preside in and hold 
          Courts of Chancery there, for the hearing of causes and the 
          dispatch of such business as shall be depending in the said 
          Court. We have taken the opinion of Mr. Fane, one of your 
          Majesty's Counsel learned in the law, and he conceives the 
          several provisions therein contained, not to be lyable to 
          any objection in point of law, save in one particular only, 
          where it is attempted to exclude all Courts held in any other 
          country except in the island of Antigua, from making decrees 
          or orders in case of suit for lands, tenements or hereditaments, 
          where the interest or thing sued for, shall lye in that island, 
          and in case of personal demands where the person or persons 
          of the defendant or defendants are or shall be resident in the 
          said island, for tho' he is of opinion that this clause will not 
          be sufficient to restrain the jurisdiction of any of the Courts 
          in <placeName ref="#gb" role="secondary">Great Britain</placeName>, yet he thinks, it seems to be particularly 
          calculated against the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery 
          here, which is an attempt which ought to be discountenanced. 
          We have likewise been attended by several merchants and 
          planters, who are desirous that this act should receive your 
          Majesty's royal approbation. The principal reason offered 
          in support of this act, and contained in the preamble, are, that 
          the inhabitants labour under great delays and inconveniences 
          in the prosecuting of their rights in Chancery, by reason of the 
          Chief Governor's frequent and long absence from Antigua, and 
          from a power exercised by the said Govrs. of granting and 
          dissolving of injunctions in causes depending in Antigua, whilst 
          they are resident in some other of the <placeName ref="#leeward" role="indirect">Leeward Islands</placeName>;
          and we are of opinion that proper remedies should be provided 
          against these evils. We have no objection therefore to such 
          parts of this act as relate simply to the regulation of proceedings 
          in the Court of Chancery ; but we cannot approve that part 
          of it, whereby the Lieut. General, in the absence of your 
          Majesty's Capt. General, or the Lt. Govr. etc. in their absence 
          are enabled to preside in and hold Courts of Chancery, because 
          we do apprehend that the appointment of Judges and 
          Chancellors, being a very material part of the royal prerogative, 
          ought always to be exercised immediately by your Majesty, 
          or, by some persons to whom your Majesty shall especially 
          delegate that power, and not by a clause in an act of Assembly, 
          and the rather, because your Majesty may from time to time 
          make such alterations or additions to your Royal orders and 
          appointments as may be suitable to the occasions and advantage 
          of your subjects, but an act of Assembly cannot be repealed, 
          whatever inconveniences may ensue from it, without the consent 
          of the people. The most proper method, therefore, in our 
          humble opinion, of attaining what is proposed by this act, 
          most suitable to your Majesty's royal prerogative, and equally 
          safe and expedient for the people of Antigua, would be, that 
          your Majesty should be pleased especially to appoint some 
          person in Antigua to preside as Chancellor, and execute all the 
          functions of that Office, in the absence of your Majesty's Capt. 
          General or Commander in Chief, by which means the course 
          of Justice would be continued without interruption, and the 
          complaint, which has been so much insisted upon, of granting 
          and revoking injunctions by the Governor General, when absent 
          from Antigua, might likewise be entirely removed. The only 
          objection to the doing of this now, arises from some words in 
          the first Chancery act already refer'd to, whereby it is presumed 
          your Majesty cannot, in any case or on any emergency, appoint 
          another person to preside in the said Court, during the residence 
          of the Commander in Chief in any other of the Leeward Islands, 
          because it is by that law enacted, that from henceforth all and 
          every Court and Courts of Chancery which shall be holden for 
          this island of Antigua, shall consist of and be holden by the 
          Capt. General or Governor in Chief etc., and five or more of the 
          Council of this island at least. But if this be a real difficulty 
          it is at least a difficulty which the Assembly of Antigua may 
          easily remove by a new law, whereby your Majesty may be 
          impowered, notwithstanding the aforesaid Chancery act, or 
          anything therein contained from time to time to nominate 
          such person or persons as your Majesty shall think most proper 
          to supply the duty of the Commander in Chief, and preside, 
          during his absence, in the Court of Chancery in Antigua, may 
          do ; But upon this occasion, we cannot help observing, that 
          great caution ought to be had in making concessions of this 
          sort to any Colony, when an uncommon favour already granted, 
          is made use of, as an argument to obtain another still more 
          extraordinary. The people of Antigua are already upon a 
          different footing from the rest of the Leeward Islands, by virtue 
          of the law which this act is intended to amend : For in Antigua 
          only the Councillors have the right of sitting and voting in the 
          Court of Chancery with your Majesty's Governor ; But if this 
          new act should pass, the Council with their President, may 
          some times have opportunities of deciding causes without the 
          assistance of the Capt. Genl., Lieut. Genl., or Lieut. Governor, 
          whose presence may reasonably be assumed to be some 
          check upon their proceedings, which might possibly be 
          subject to strong influences, from consanguinity at least, in 
          an island where all the principal inhabitants, by frequent 
          intermarriages, are nearly related. For all which reasons, we 
          humbly propose that your Majesty should be pleased to signify 
          your disallowance of this act. [C.O. 153, 15. pp. 98-105.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. Representation upon Act of 
          <placeName ref="#us_ny" role="direct">New York</placeName>, 1730, to prevent the taking 
          or levying on specialities more than the principal, interest and 
          cost of suit, and other purposes therein mentioned etc. Continue : 
          Mr. Fane has made several objections to the confirmation 
          of it, which are both of a legal and prudential nature. The Act 
          appears to have taken its rise from some late executions had 
          upon judgments obtained in the Province of New York, whereby 
          the whole penalties of the bonds have been levied instead of 
          the sums really due, and to prevent this practice for the future, 
          this law provides that if, upon any judgment obtained, or upon 
          actions brought and agreed before judgment, any plaintiff or 
          his attorney shall take or levy more than the principal debt, 
          lawful interest and costs of suit, the person or persons so 
          offending shall forfeit double damages to the party grieved, 
          with treble costs of suit, to be recovered in any Court of Record 
          in the province of New York. To this provision, it is objected 
          that according to the practice of the Law Courts in <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName>, 
          plaintiffs do always recover the whole penalties of their bonds, 
          but should they levy more than the real debt, with cost and 
          charges, the party grieved has a remedy by a bill in equity, in 
          which case the plaintiff shall refund with costs, and the people 
          of New York have not only the same opportunity of redressing 
          themselves in a Court of Equity, but likewise an easier way of 
          obtaining Justice, because their common law courts will, upon 
          motion, examine in a summary way into any wrong of that 
          sort, which is what the common law courts in England cannot 
          do, whereby the injured party is obliged to sue for relief in a 
          Court of Equity. It is likewise apprehended that this Act 
          will tend to multiply litigious suits at law, by encouraging the 
          debtor not to oppose or remonstrate against an unwarrantable 
          levy in execution of judgment, or what is still worse, by tempting 
          him to agree in appearance to any exorbitant demand of the 
          plaintiff, and accordingly to pay more than was really due to 
          him, with no other prospect than that of recovering double 
          damages and treble costs of suit, in which case, his gain upon 
          recovery would be proportionable to the money he had 
          knowingly paid in his own wrong. We therefore humbly 
          propose that your Majesty should be pleased to signify your 
          disallowance of it etc. [C.O. 5, 1125. pp. 162-164.]</p>

          Lt. Governor Gordon to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. On the 29th ult. I had the honour to receive 
          your Lordships' commands of 8th Sept. delivered to me by 
          Mr. Browne etc. I am so conscious, my Lords, of having done 
          nothing with relation to Mr. Brown but what is just and well 
          to be defended, that I may venture to assure your Lordships 
          his complaint shall receive a proper answer. I have given him 
          regular notice to attend the examinations on my side etc. with 
          leave to cross-examine ; and he hath already heard such 
          depositions as must make him ashamed to have troubled your 
          Lordships with an affair so frivolous with respect to me, and so 
          exceedingly dishonourable to himself etc. Continues : In 
          answer to a paragraph in your Lordships' said orders etc., when 
          I received a deputation from the Proprietors etc., I had their 
          instructions to correspond frequently with them, and to acquaint 
          them with the state of their Province, which I have punctually 
          done etc. ; I likewise knew it was my duty to acquaint H.M. 
          Ministers and particularly your Right Honourable Board, in 
          case anything of moment which might be for H.M. service 
          should occurr, and to acknowledge and pay due obedience to 
          those directions I should receive from them, which last I have 
          never neglected to doe. But in <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="direct">this inland Province</placeName>
          so few things happen of any consequence to H.M. interest, and scarce 
          any at all have happened since my arrival here, that I judged 
          it improper to take up your Lordships' time with matters of 
          so small importance. Signed, P. Gordon. Endorsed, Recd.

          Gambling for the Council. Continues : I seldom have more 
          than six to attend in Council, which is a great prejudice to the King's service.
          The 26th ulto. I met the new Assembly of <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">this Province</placeName>
          and by their Journal to this time now inclos'd your 
          Lordships will see, they are of the same stamp with the last 
          Assemblies. Nor have I the least expectation of their making 
          any step towards a complyance with the King's Instruction, 
          as to my support, nor do they seem to pay the least deference 
          to any thing that is called an Instruction. I must therefore 
          desire your Lordships wou'd send me the King's leave to receive 
          my support in the way the Assembly is willing to give it, for it 
          cannot be thought consonant to reason, justice or honour that 
          I should go on to support the character of the King's Governour 
          at the great expense of my own estate. With great submission 
          to your Lordships my taking the sum the King has appointed 
          me in the manner the Assembly are willing to pay it cannot 
          prevent or anyways affect what H.M. in his royal wisdom shall 
          think fit to do, for his own honour, in seeing that his orders 
          have all possible obedience paid them. I have in this and 
          every point acted with the strictest fidelity to the King's honour 
          and service, and it is a severe thing for his faithfull servants 
          to suffer in their estates as I have done ever since my arrival. 
          I hope your Lordships will consider my hard case, and let me 
          have the leave I desire, and was granted to former Governours, 
          who had Instructions of the nature of mine, etc. Signed, J. 
          Belcher. Endorsed, Recd. 5th July, Read 4th Aug., 1731.

          Minutes of Privy Council. Major General Hunter's 
          letter of 4th July, 1730, with the papers inclosed, representing 
          the defenceless condition of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName> the orders sent to him 
          upon them in the Duke of Newcastle's several letters of 12th 
          Oct. and 9th and 30th Nov. were read. And Maj. Gen. 
          Hunter's letters of 23rd Jan., 11th Feb., 17th and 20th March 
          and 2nd and 3rd April giving an account of the receipt of those 
          orders, and of the arrival of the two Regiments at Jamaica 
          were also read. The Secretary at War acquainted the Lords 
          that he had received letters from Maj. Gen. Hunter of the 
          same date and to the same purpose, as also one fom Colo. 
          Hayes, dated Match 9, 1730/1, with advice of the defeat of the 
          negroes and the burning of <placeName ref="#jm_nannytown" role="direct">their town</placeName>; and representing the 
          bad condition of the quarters provided for the soldiers who 
          sicken and dye fast, and that only two companies of his regiment 
          are together ; the rest being dispersed in quarters all over the 
          island ; which letters were read. Several other letters from 
          officers and other persons at Jamaica (enumerated) were read, 
          all which agree in the account of the sickness of the regiments, 
          many of both regiments being ill of fevers and fluxes ; that it 
          increased daily ; that several officers and abundance of the 
          men were dead ; that at the funeral of Colo. Hayes the whole 
          Regmt. were in tears, the surviving Officers almost dead ; 
          that their men dyed daily ; and that the two regiments would 
          soon fall a victim : that their accommodations were not good ; 
          that no provision was made for them or care taken of them ; 
          that three Companies of each Regimt. were sent to <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, 
          a very unhealthy place, which were still on board, 
          quarters not being ready for them ; and the rest were disperst 
          all over the island ; and some in places where there were no 
          rebellious negroes ; except only two companies, that were 
          kept together ; that there seemed to be no want of the troops 
          there, unless it were to make them planters ; and if the two 
          Independant Companies were compleat, they would be more 
          in number than the detachment of the regiments which is 
          sent to that part where the rebellious negroes are ; that the 
          affair of the negroes is a trifle, that they had been defeated and 
          their town burnt ; that there had never been more than 30 of 
          them together, that the people of the Island did not value 
          them, nor were in general much pleased with the regiments. 
          A letter from the Lords Commrs. of the Admiralty, 15th 
          March, 1730/1 inclosing copy of one they had received from 
          Major General Hunter concerning the defenceless condition of 
          Jamaica, and his Grace's answer to them of 5th April, with 
          another letter from them of 1st May were read. Their Lordps., 
          upon consideration of the several letters, and finding great 
          difference in the accounts from ye Govr. of Jamaica, and the 
          officers and other persons there, as well with relation to the 
          health and condition of the regiments, as to the service and use 
          they may be of for the security of the island, and the suppressing 
          of the rebellious negroes ; and being informed, that Capt. Dent 
          is daily expected from thence, who is well acquainted with the 
          state and condition of the island, their Lordps. think it most 
          for H.M. service to deferr giving any oppinion in this matter 
          till such time as they have received further information from 
          Capt. Dent, and by the letters he will bring from Jamaica. In 
          the mean time the Board of Trade are desired to enquire of the 
          merchants what necessity they apprehend there may be for 
          the continuance of those regiments at Jamaica. 4 1/3 pp. [C.O. 5, 36. ff. 9-11.]</p>

          Col. Dunbar to Mr. Popple. Has had no opportunity 
          of answering his letter of 11th Feb. Refers to his three former 
          letters etc. Continues : The Penobscot Indians have had 
          such impressions given them of us that they seem a little jealous 
          and have not come so frequently among us as usual ; however 
          I am sure if I am enabled to make them a few prests. instead 
          of disturbing us, I will undertake by degrees to settle all along 
          the coast by their consent etc. Repeats that he has been obliged 
          to make some small lots of land etc. (v. C.S.P. Nov. 17, 1730). 
          Continues : In <placeName ref="#rv_johns" role="direct">John's River</placeName> about four miles from
          <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Fredericksfort</placeName> I layd out a township wch. I called by the name of 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_harrington" role="direct">Harrington</placeName>, and yt. river by ye same name, where I made a 
          plan of a regular towne, fronting navigable water, and gave 
          fourty acre lotts to the people contiguous to the towne, there 
          are now there 76 familys, who have cleared part of their lotts 
          and have made gardens and small plantations, and are burning 
          bricks and prepareing to build houses being much incommoded 
          by the weather in poor wigwams or cottages in which they 
          live at present. <placeName ref="#rv_damariscotta" role="direct">Damarescotty river</placeName> whose entrance from the 
          fort from the sea is but three leagues, I have called Walpole 
          river, wch. is very deep and wide, and runs 20 miles navigable 
          into the country, upon the east side of it I have layd out a 
          regular compact town by ye name of <placeName ref="#us_me_walpole" role="direct">Walpole</placeName>,
          and in it there are at this time 94 familys, on the west side opposite to it I 
          have planted another town and called it <placeName ref="#us_me_townshend" role="direct">Townshend</placeName>, not above 
          25 familyes are yet there, many of the people being gone for 
          their wives and cattle. <placeName ref="#rv_sheepscot" role="direct">Shepscot river</placeName> enters but 2 leagues 
          from Walpole river, and is very large, upon ye east side of it I 
          have planted a towne which wth. the river I have called 
          <placeName ref="#us_me_newcastle" role="direct">Newcastle</placeName>, and there I have fixed the people who first petitiond 
          H.M. for leave to settle to ye Eastward of <placeName ref="#rv_kennebec" role="indirect">Kennebeck river</placeName>, 
          there are near a hundd. familys there ; from the west side of 
          ye river to Kennebeck which is about 8 miles, there is
          <placeName ref="#us_me_woolwich" role="direct">a fine growth of large white pines, and oak</placeName>
          wch., in Nov. 1729, I layd apart for ye use of the Royal Navy, and gave publique notice 
          thereof, notwithstanding which some New England people 
          who call themselves ye Shepscot Company, have committed 
          great waste and have, the last winter, cutt down 154 mast trees 
          into loggs for houses and fences by way of takeing possession of 
          ye lands, but I am prosecuting them for it. <placeName ref="#rv_muscongus" role="direct">Moscougus river</placeName> 
          enters from the sea, abt. 12 miles N.E. from Fredericksfort, a 
          number of New England people who called themselves the 
          Moscougus Company, came to me upon my first arrival at 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="indirect">Boston</placeName> and when I told them of the King's intentions and 
          termes of settling that country, they in a very dutyfull manner 
          thankfully accepted thereof, and I told them that no others 
          should have those lands, and that all others of H.M. Protestant 
          subjects who would do the same should also settle where they 
          pleased. Accordingly those people are come and comeing 
          thither. I have called it <placeName ref="#us_ma_torrington" role="direct">Torrington</placeName>, wch. bounds on ye west 
          and N.W. upon Fredericksfort and Harrington ; Harrington 
          and Walpole lines meet, and Townsend and Newcastle ; the 
          people have agreed this season to cutt strait cart-roads from 
          towne, to build ferrys upon ye rivers and to erect beacons in 
          proper places, the soil is extraordinary and the country not 
          at all mountainous, it is covered with wood in veins, some 
          places red oak wch. is oriely fitt for potash, dry cask and firewood, 
          in other places white oak fitt for ship timber and wett cask, 
          some parts mostly spruce, and all intermixed with some ash, 
          birch, maple and popple or asp trees, very few pines and those 
          stunted trees which are onely fitt for boards and shingles, 
          without which no buildings can be carryed on. Every towne 
          has clay fitt for bricks, and which will be cheaper to ye people 
          than wooden houses ; great numbers of men are dayly flocking 
          hither, and I am now upon laying out another towne by the 
          name of Westmorland upon a <placeName ref="#lk_biscay" role="direct">fresh pond of thirty miles long</placeName> 
          above Walpole, they are now encouraged by letters from <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="secondary">London</placeName>
          that ye claims are all rejected, and I should not have presumed 
          to have proceeded thus farr but that I had ye same account 
          from London some months agoe, and there was an absolute 
          necessity for it, besides no claimants on these parts made any 
          application at home, but waited the issue of Mr. Waldo's 
          sollicitation wch. would determine all the rest, and he was to 
          have half of the lands he should get confirmed. If it had not 
          been for Doctor Cook and him, noe opposition would have ever 
          been made to the settlements, but all would have acquiesced, 
          as those of Muscougus had done, and to shew the nature of their 
          titles etc. repeats stay of John Brown (v. C.S.P. 17th Nov., 1730). 
          Continues : When I told some of ye purchasers of this affair, 
          they ownd they gave ye man ye mony but sayd it was in charity, 
          and he made them a present of the deed in return, wch. they
          layd no stress upon, haveing Indian deeds for ye same lands, 
          to wch. I have seen no less than 3 such titles from different Indns. 
          to different people ; I onely mention this to shew that I was 
          willing to make no distinction between the King's subjects but 
          receive all who would accept H.M. favour, this may prove Mr. 
          Waldoe's chief plea in his petition to be false, vizt. that I had 
          dispossd. several people from their antient possessions and 
          inheritances, whereas I do solemnly declare that there was but 
          one family between the island of <placeName ref="#is_arrowsic" role="boundary">Arrowzick</placeName> in Kennebeck river 
          and the truck-house at Georges 10 leagues eastward of 
          Fredericksfort, when I first came hither, namely Doctor 
          Winslow's, now at the town of Townshend, and he is there still 
          and was never disturbed nor threatend to be disturbed ; this 
          is all yt. I can think material for me to take notice of in answer 
          to that petition, but to observe that if your claim is allowed, 
          there are so many more of the same nature yt. H.M. can have 
          no reserve in that country for ye Royal Navy, and besides 
          allowing one Indian's title, is an acknowledgmt. that ye Indians 
          have a right to dispose of all ye rest of ye lands, and may sett 
          what vallue they please upon it, or refuse to sell, and thus the 
          planting a usefull Collony will be defeated, wch. besides a 
          handsome revenue to the Crowne will consume abundance of 
          English manufactures, and returns made for them in hemp, 
          flax and pottashes wch. <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> now purchases mostly with 
          ready mony, and from countrys whose friendship is precarious. 
          Mr. Waldo and his party being sensible of the weakness of their 
          title, have lately purchased an additional one, wch. they 
          imagined one Mr. Nelson had to all <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName>. Mr. Nelson 
          is an antient gentleman near 80 years of age, was a relation to 
          Sr. Thomas Temple who was in these parts near seventy years 
          agoe, he confessed to Mr. Waldoes frds. when they offered to 
          treat with him for his title that he had no sort of right, and yt. 
          if any remain'd, derived from his uncle Sr. Thomas Temple it 
          must be in my Lord Cobham who is heir to him, but even his 
          Lordship had none, because Sir Thomas's grant for Nova Scotia 
          was but dureing his own life, if this be true the records in 
          England must prove it. Notwithstanding this honest 
          declaration from Mr. Nelson, Mr. Waldo's friends insisted 
          upon buying his title and offerd 100£. <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="secondary">New England</placeName> mony, 
          wch. he has wthin. this month accepted, and perfected deeds, 
          wch. no doubt will be trumped up at ye Council Board in 
          England before this can reach home ; this is a cheap purchase 
          for Nova Scotia, which to the eastward of Kennebeck river 
          will be upwards of fourscore millions of acres, and ye 100£. 
          not worth more than so many ounces of silver ; 'tis much an 
          easier purchase than Mr. Waldo would willingly have made 
          abt. 30 months agoe in England, when one day Mr. Gulston, 
          he and I dined at <placeName ref="#en_lon_pontacks" role="secondary">Pontacks</placeName> and talking of settling these parts, 
          wch. was then in agitation, Mr. Waldo sayd yt. he had some 
          pretentions to a neck of land between <placeName ref="#rv_stgeorge" role="boundary">St. Georges river</placeName> and 
          <placeName ref="#rv_penobscot" role="boundary">Penobscot</placeName>, and if I could putt him in a way how to gett his 
          claim confirmed by H.M. he would give a thousand guins. to 
          any one about Court who would serve him therein. I answered 
          that I did not know how or where to make any such application 
          of mony. Mr. Gulston I believe would scorn to lye and I 
          appeal to him for his testimony herein ; that claim of Mr. 
          Waldo and Compa. (as they call themselves) is near 600,000 
          acres, reckoning onely from St. Georges to Penobscot, but now 
          by his petition he would include Mt. Muscougos, wch. etc. 
          another sett of people claim and are actually settleing, waveing 
          any pretentions but under the new terms, which many of the 
          better sort of people tell me does ye more incourage them, 
          because they will be under a Kingly Governmt. and hope for 
          H.M. more immediate countenance, which these parts could 
          never expect from the <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="indirect">Masachusetts Bay</placeName>, being at too great 
          a distance from them, and it may appear from ye addresses 
          contained in the 4 printed books sent by me to His Grace ye 
          Duke of Newcastle and to my Lords Commrs. for Trade 
          and Plantations soon after my arrival at Boston, that the 
          Masachusets people refused to build the fort at <placeName ref="#us_me_pemaquid" role="indirect">Pemaquid</placeName> as 
          being too remote from their Province, and therefore could be 
          of no advantage to them, the opposition now given to the 
          settlements is the pure effect of their principles for opposition 
          sake, and not with any designe of settleing it themselves, they 
          haveing land enough in the Masachusets province for 40,000 
          familys more than they have in ye country, besides the large 
          <placeName ref="#us_me" role="indirect">province of Main</placeName> which from
          <placeName ref="#rv_piscataqua" role="indirect">Piscatua River</placeName> to Kennebeck is nearer 100 than 90 miles, 
          30 of which at this time from <placeName ref="#us_me_northyarmouth" role="indirect">North Yarmouth</placeName>
          in <placeName ref="#by_casco" role="indirect">Casco Bay</placeName> has not 30 familys upon it, ye other 
          70 to Piscatua river, wch. parts it from <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="indirect">New Hampshire</placeName> has 
          onely one line of townships along ye seashore and those but 8 
          miles deep into the country, except on Piscatua river ye town 
          of <placeName ref="#us_me_berwick" role="indirect">Berwick</placeName> 15 miles from the sea ; there are but small 
          improvemts. in these towns, they live chiefly by their saw-mills, 
          and are not to be restraind by any law yet in being, nor can the 
          most diligent officers prevent such numbers of disobedient 
          people, who very little regard the King's authority and very 
          frequently insult his officers, a flagrant instance of this lately 
          happened to one Capt. Lancelot a master of a ship who was 
          attacqued, severely wounded and robbed, his wounds were 
          such as that the people imagined they had killed him by their 
          boasting that they had destroyed one Surveyor of ye Woods. 
          He was a little man and was taken for Mr. Slade one of my 
          Deputys at that time near ye same place upon his duty, who 
          sent his horse for Mr. Lancelot to carry him to a surgn., this 
          fact was related in one of the Boston newspapers, and is since 
          confirmed to me by Mr. Slade etc. Refers to and repeats part 
          of his letters Jan. 12th etc., the quit-rents due and the titles 
          produced by the inhabitants for the lands, " particularly Collo. 
          Westbrook." Continues : It may be worth consideration 
          at home whether to demand the said arrears, in default of 
          paymt. the title reverts to the Crowne ; all those patents were 
          so much esteemed that they are registered in the town books 
          of <placeName ref="#us_me_york" role="direct">York</placeName> which is the county towne etc. York is but 7 miles 
          from the river of Piscataqua, and thither upon all sessions and 
          sizes people from the west side of Kennebeck are obliged to 
          resort upon all occasions near 90 miles, and what is yet harder 
          upon them, they send representatives to Boston, 60 miles 
          westward of Piscatua, and must follow any appeals thither to 
          ye Governour and Council, and travel thro' the body of the 
          Governmt. of New Hampshire ; there are many people tearing 
          one another to pieces upon disputes of lands in the province of 
          Maine, many familys at Casco who have settled and improved 
          thereabouts for several years are now to be turn'd out by old 
          claimants to the same lands who have layn dormant, and they 
          are now to loose the benefit of their buildings and improvemts. 
          by some new comers, among whom are Mr. Waldo and Mr. 
          Westbrook who lately purchased the old titles for trifles, on 
          purpose for erecting saw mills, as those lands are chiefly covered 
          with large white pine trees. When I was at Casco in January 
          last, ye Selectmen came to me in behalf of many others, and 
          prayed me to represent their grievances home, and asked my 
          approbation to call a towne meeting to aggree upon a petition 
          to H.M. to annex them to this province, but I declined it, and 
          now I have fresh application to beg in the name (as they say 
          of 2/3) of the province of Maine that I would putt them in a way 
          to lay their grievances before H.M., and how they may be 
          annexed either to New Hampshire or Georgia, but I gave no 
          answer, than, that I could not appear in it, but if they would 
          send my petition to one of the Secretarys of State, or to my 
          Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations and send 
          substantial proof of their allegations it would be enquired 
          into, and an answer wd. be returnd to them. I beg pardon 
          for this long digression, and leave to observe the opinion of the 
          Indians of ye pretended sale of lands by their ancestors, they 
          say that their lands are unalienable, that their ancestors had 
          onely a natural right dureing their own lives, and could not 
          deprive their posterity of the same right, no more than they 
          could take away their lives, nor do they pretend to any such 
          right over their children, the tribes are much diminished, and 
          many of them extinct ; it is very observable that when any 
          settlemts. are made, ye Indians have insensibly decreased, and 
          when any tribe is reduced to a few, they quit that place and 
          incorporate with other tribes, and so the names of them are 
          extinct ; the descendants of some in whose names formal 
          deeds are trumpd. up, do, notwithstanding claim ye lands sold 
          by their ancestors, and have offerd to sell their right dureing 
          their own lives, but pretend to no more. In my first letter to 
          His Grace the Duke of Newcastle and to my Lords Commrs. 
          I acquainted them, upon my return from Fredericksfort, 
          that the Proprietor of ye lands there offered to sell his right 
          to me for a trifle. My answer was, before a great number of the 
          Indians, that I was not come there to buy lands, for yt. all 
          belonged to ye King of England who sent me to settle his 
          subjects here, and no man had a right to sell any, upon this the 
          Indians seemed grave and kept silence awhile, and then the 
          proprietor told me with a smile, that King George was welcome, 
          and I was welcome. I have in all my former letters sayd soe 
          much of this country and of ye many different claims and titles 
          to ye very same lands, yt. I can onely add, that if any of them 
          are allowed, it will lay foundations for eternal suits and disputes 
          among the people and endless appeals home, if ever this country 
          be settled under those claimts., and besides it will create quarrels 
          among ye descendants of the Indians who formerly sold, each 
          of them insisting that the title their ancestors gave, is best. 
          Upon the whole if H.M. allows one claim, he cannot avoyd 
          allowing all under ye same case and then he may give over any 
          expectation of ever hearing of a good settlement here or any 
          advantage to ye Crowne. In some of my former letters I gave 
          you an account of large claims eastward of Penobscot, one of 
          20 miles square to Mr. Winnet, now of ye Council of Nova 
          Scotia, by a grant from the French Governour before ye 
          reduction of yt. province. To conclude I beg leave to referr 
          to a printed case and state of the Crown's title to these lands 
          signed by Dr. Pinfold after ye former disputes before His late 
          Majesty in Council about ye year 1718, when for many reasons 
          therein mentioned, ye title was absolutely declared to be in the 
          Crowne. Now Sir in answer to what my Lords Commissioners 
          are pleased to say relateing to the expenses I have made in 
          laying the foundation of this Settlement. I most humbly 
          thank their Ldsps. for the good offices they intend me, and 
          herewith I send you an honest account of my disbursemts., 
          so farr as I conceive they are for publique service, and I 
          chearfully submit it to my Lords how farr they are soe ; As to 
          the part respecting the Indians it is unavoydable, and if their 
          Lordships will be pleased to look over my 23rd Instruction 
          etc., it will appear how much reason I had to bestow somewhat 
          upon these people, and yt. Instruction has farther encouraged 
          me to promise that if by their behaviour, they deserved it, H.M. 
          would order them some small presents, in blankits, corn, small 
          shot and powder for their hunting ; they are now expecting 
          them and it will be quite impossible for me not to give some- 
          thing, I hope my Lords will recomend it ; two hundred 
          pds. pr. year, until the quit-rent and the other penny to defray 
          the province charges commences, will be sufficient, wch. sum 
          must mostly be layd out in blankets, powder, swan, goose and
          duck shot, laced hatts of about 10s. sterl. each, and some flints 
          from London. As for travelling charges for me and my 
          Deputys, I believe it is usual for all rideing officers, some of 
          them are very rarely long in a place, and it is not easy to imagine 
          the expence they are at and the fateague of travelling in this 
          country, they are all in debt and cannot attend this duty without 
          some addition, or travelling charges, in my humble opinion 
          fifty pounds pr. ann. added to each of them in lieu of travelling 
          charges would be a less expence than to pay them pr. diem. 
          I will allways keep them full imployed ; I submit my own 
          expences to my Lords' recommendation, and hope they will allow 
          that I have not been idle ; the sum I charge for sloop hire and 
          men and victuals is all payd and charged to me, it was impossible 
          without it to give any description of ye parts which I have 
          done in my letters ; I formerly proposed that if 200£. was 
          allowed me I would build a proper coasting sloop, and would 
          maintain her for so much pr. ann. ; this would enable me to 
          view ye coast and rivers, prevent any abuses, and go any where 
          on H.M. service. As for the other articles in my account, I 
          found it quite impracticable to lay any foundation for a settle- 
          ment, without some cover and security for the people, and 
          therefore raised a dry stone wall 4 1/2 feet thick, upon ye ruins 
          of ye old fort, wch. also commands a fine harbour, and protects 
          vessels against any insult from the Indians, or other enemy, 
          and so by degrees I was insensibly drawn into this expence. 
          Any part of it that will be ordered me, I shall thankfully receive 
          as so much given, and if any is deducted I hope it will be allowed 
          out of the quit rents when they become due ; and were I not 
          under incumbrances here upon account of those expences I 
          would be well contented to be payd out of ye quit rents etc. 
          As for the publique advantages accrueing hereby I have onely 
          this to say, that if recovering a fine and a vast country from a 
          wilderness and planting an usefull Collony there, raiseing a 
          small fortification with the King's flag, a few ship guns, small 
          armes and ammunition, and putting it in a posture of defence, 
          and by inconsiderable presents reconcileing the savages to 
          receive H.M. subjects with good will and friendship, instead 
          of forceing them at an expence of blood and mony, or letting 
          it remain a wilderness for ever, if this be not deemed to be of 
          publique use and advantage is most humbly submitted to my 
          superiors. It is now the 18th of June, 4 days ago Major Cosby 
          arrived here with an Officer, serjt. and drummer and twenty 
          men from Governour Philips's regt. from Canso. I wrote to 
          the Governour in September last pursuant to my Instructions 
          to send me 30 men, upon apprehensions that the Indians would 
          give us some uneasyness being incited thereunto, but I hope 
          nothing will persuade them to it ; if there had been occasion 
          it appears by this how impracticable it is to depend upon any 
          assistance from Nova Scotia. The Officer and his men are well 
          lodged within the fort, and brought their provisions and 
          ammunition with them. My letters are generally so very long 
          that I fear it prevents their being taken into consideration. 
          I have no other pleasure in writeing, but as I think it my duty, 
          and I am really not able to do it according to my Comn. 
          and Instructions to correspond with ye other Offices. I am 
          frequently troubled with a little of the palsy, and cannot afford 
          to keep any Clerk or Assistant, nor indeed to live myself, upon 
          my present income in my ordinary expences etc. Continues : 
          I am like to suffer here yt. I have no answer to the appeals I 
          sent home etc. I have given security to prosecute ye appeals 
          in a year, or to pay treble costs ; I made no doubt of a decree 
          against Wyer upon my appeal sent to you 14 months agoe. 
          The stock of paper etc. which I brought wth. me at my own 
          expence is near out. I never had one sheet of paper given me, 
          wch. others are allowed that make less use of it. I pray Sir 
          that you will recommend this to my Lords and that you will 
          watch an opertunity at their leisure to lay this long epistle before 
          their Lordships with my most humble duty and thanks for all 
          their favours, which as I am going to New Hampshire I shall 
          take another oppertunity to do from thence. P.S. I hope 
          by the honour I have of being a sub to Mr. Belcher in the Lt. 
          Governour's Commission of N. Hampshire, it is not intended 
          to take me from ye new settlemts. If I am allowed a sloop 
          I will engage to do anything yt. may be required of me in each 
          place. Encloses, a list of (19) forges and (6) furnaces in

          my last, of which herewith goes a duplicate, there has nothing 
          fallen out extraordinary <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">here</placeName>. The Genll. Assembly was

          Encloses Address etc., " which contains fair promises. I shall 
          not answer for the performances. Something may be done 
          in the affair of the quit rents : They have resolved to subsist 
          the two regiments for six months more. They are all at their 
          several quarters, those in the country have suffered least being 
          farther from rum than these in the towns, and generally speaking 
          the whole well barrackt or lodg'd. The inclosed petition etc. 
          was this day given me by the Chief Justice and the other Judges 
          etc. The girl said nothing in her own defence on her tryal, 
          but after sentence, the matter appear'd so plain, that the Bench 
          ordered the woman to be prosecuted for perjury and recom- 
          mended the unhappy young woman as an object of H.M. mercy, 
          and I am an humble suitor to your Grace that her pardon may 
          be granted etc. When the Session is over I shall inform your 
          Grace more particularly of affairs etc. Signed, Ro. Hunter.

          strengthning and securing the island and restoring 
          its credit ; introducing white settlers, and rendering

          in her defence, being afraid of prejudicing in her 
          business, her mistress, the first witness at her trial, 
          who is a school-mistress and has maintained and 
          employed her ever since her parents died when she 
          was very young, if it should become known that she 
          was acquainted with her being with child and with 
          her delivery, petitioner little doubting but that her 
          mistress as she often promised would on her trial set 
          forth the facts etc. Altho' she was not so happy to 
          be amongst people who had compassion enough to 
          listen to her crys, yet she made earnest and loud 
          complaints and three several times sent out one of 
          the scholars to call Mrs. Laugher, wch. scholar was 
          in Court ready to give her testimony, but was not

          Same to the Duke of Newcastle. Abstract. Enclose 
          extract from Governor Montgomery's letter, 21st Dec., 1730, 
          relating to the trading house intended to be erected by the 
          French in the <placeName ref="#us_ny_iroquoia" role="direct">Sennekees' country</placeName>. His Grace is fully apprized 
          of the arts used by the French to withdraw the affections of 
          the Five Nations from the English, contrary to the intent of 
          the 15th article of the Treaty. The same consequences are to 
          be apprehended from this new trading house, as have really 
          happen'd from that erected some years ago at <placeName ref="us_ny_fortniagara" role="direct">Niagara</placeName>, which 
          is now converted into a fort, by which the French have gained 
          a possession in that place. Refer to their representations to 
          Lord Carteret on that point. The French have now taken 
          the very same steps in a country to which they have not the 
          colour of any title, and should they be permitted to go on, 
          might be of very fatal consequence to our Indian Nations, who 
          might thereby be drawn from their allegiance to H.M. etc.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the Committee 
          of Privy Council. Report upon petition of Ex-Governor 
          Phenny. State case and quote Peter Goudet, Treasurer of the 
          <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">Bahamas</placeName>, that the sums raised during his administration were 
          justly applied to the service of the public, and accounted for 
          to the Assembly. The Assembly's objections appear to relate 
          solely to the legality of the method by which the mony was 
          levied. There was no assembly constituted during his 
          government, so that the money was raised by the highest 
          authority which then subsisted, and by the same power as his 
          predecessor had levied taxes for the same purposes. Continue : 
          We think Mr. Phenny's proceeding to be very justifiable 
          from that part of his Commission whereby he was authorized 
          to do everything that might conduce to the security of his 
          Government, the good of the people, and the honour of the 
          Crown. Acts of this kind have their foundation in reason, and
          are vindicated from their own necessity, as well as by the 
          practice of England towards infant Colonies. It may be further 
          alledged in Mr. Phenney's favour, that the aforesaid levies were 
          approved at the Quarter Sessions of the Island, which was the 
          most popular Court that could take cognizance of such matters, 
          before the constitution of the Assembly and the people of the 
          Bahamas did concur in several addresses to Mr. Phenney, 
          approving his whole conduct. It would be a very great hardship 
          therefore if he should be obliged to stand the event of a suit 
          at law in the Bahamas upon the abovementioned bond ; and 
          we have no objection why H.M. may not be graciously pleased 
          to order his Governor to deliver the said bond to Mr. Phenney's 
          Attorney, in order to be cancelled. With respect to the sloops 
          fitted out by Mr. Phenney, to fetch provisions for the garrison 
          at the Bahamas, altho' he may have been a considerable sufferer 
          by their being cast away in their return to those islands, yet 
          as it does not appear to us that he had any orders for that 
          equipment ; we can only submit this article, together with that 
          of the fortifications, upon which Mr. Phenney appears to have 
          taken a great deal of pains, to H.M. goodness and compassion.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. It 
          having been lately represented to us, that inconveniences may 
          arise from the devolution of Government in the <placeName ref="#leeward" role="direct">Leeward Islands</placeName> 
          as it is at present setled by your Majesty's Commission etc., 
          whereby it is directed, that in the absence of the Capt. General 
          the chief command shall devolve upon the Lieut. General, and 
          in his absence, upon the Lieut. Govr. of <placeName ref="#nevis" role="direct">Nevis</placeName> and upon the 
          President of the Council in that Island, in the absence of the 
          Lieut. Governor. In all probability, the first cause of giving 
          this preference to Nevis, was, it's having been entirely settled 
          before any other of the Leeward Islands ; but as <placeName ref="#stchristophers" role="direct">St. Christophers</placeName> 
          and <placeName ref="#ag" role="direct">Antigua</placeName> are now become much more considerable, the 
          reason of that preference ceases, and we most humbly offer to 
          your Majesty, that for the future the chief command in these 
          islands shall, in the absence of the Capt. General and Lieut. 
          General, devolve upon the eldest Lieut. Governor being resident 
          in any of the four islands, according to the priority of their 
          commissions of Lt. Governor. We are induced to recommend 
          the Lieut. Govrs. preferrably to the Presidents of the several 
          Councils, because the former have the honour to bear your 
          Majesty's commission, and generally speaking are persons of 
          greater consequence, and better acquainted with the nature 
          and methods of command and authority ; But if it should 
          happen that neither the Governor in Chief, the Lieut. General 
          nor any of the Lieut. Govrs. should be resident in the islands, 
          we could humbly propose in that case that the chief 
          command should devolve upon the President of the Council 
          of St. Christophers, and the reason why we give preference 
          to this island is, that it was first discovered and planted by the 
          English in conjunction with the French, and had it not been 
          for that partition it would probably have been first named 
          in the Govrs' commission ; but the French part having been 
          surrendred to <placeName ref="#gb" role="descriptive">Gt. Britain</placeName> etc., it is now entirely settled by 
          your Majesty's subjects, and is become equal to, if not 
          of greater consequence than any other of the Leeward 
          Islands. The Governmt. of the Leeward Islands is now 
          devolv'd upon the President of ye Council of Nevis, and 
          we should have proposed this alteration sooner, had there ever 
          been any probability that this would have happen'd. If 
          your Majesty shall be pleased to approve of this alteration, 
          we take leave humbly to propose that it may be made in ye 
          draught of the Commission lately prepared for Col. Cosby.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. In 
          reply to 10th March, quote their letter to Govr. Belcher of 
          12th Dec. Continue : Since that time, we have reced. 
          letters from him, in which he acquaints us, that notwithstanding 
          he had formerly had, of ye next Assembly's acting more suitably 
          to your Majesty's Instructions, yet he found they would not 
          go beyond what had been settled in ye foregoing session, and 
          he was sorry to acquaint us, that ye new Assembly <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">[[ed. of Massachusetts]]</placeName>
          had gon backward, and seem'd to do nothing more than had been done 
          about forty years ago, when their present form of Government 
          was first established. Upon this, we beg leave to inform your 
          Majesty that by your 26th Instruction to Mr. Belcher, it is 
          declared to be yor. Majestie's express will and pleasure, that 
          he do not give his assent to any act, or order of Assembly etc. 
          for any gift to be made to him etc., except only in the manner 
          prescribed in the 27th Instruction, quoted (that he should 
          propose to the Assembly to pass a law declaring the salary of 
          their Governor for the time being to be 1000£ pr. ann. sterling). 
          Continue : By the Act referred to us, it is provided that ye 
          summ of " 2400£. shou'd be paid out of ye publick Treasury to 
          Jonathan Belcher Esq., etc. for ye present, as an ample and 
          honble. support, and suitable to ye dignity of his station." 
          Likewise, " That at ye beginning of ye next ensuing May 
          session, another Act should pass, for an ample and honourable 
          support to ye sd. Governor Belcher, which shou'd be annually 
          renew'd at ye beginning of every May session during his 
          government and residence in that Province," etc. In our opinion 
          the 2,400£. thereby intended to be given to the Governor is 
          contrary to his 26th Instruction, and the provision thereby 
          intended to be made, that at ye beginning of the next ensuing 
          May session another Act should pass, for an ample and honour- 
          able support to Governor Belcher, which should be annually 
          renewed etc., does, by no means come up to his 27th Instruction, 
          but seems rather calculated to leave the Govr. still dependent 
          upon ye Assembly for his support, and we are at a loss to imagine 
          how Mr. Belcher in his letter to the Duke of Newcastle could 
          think that this might be taken as a settlemt. during his 
          Governmt. [C.O. 5, 916. pp. 415-418.]</p>

          Colebrooke's obstruction in the matter of the fortifica- 
          tions etc. Continues : Having at several other times bred 
          disturbances between me and the inhabitants and also 
          encouraged the soldiers of the garrison to mutiny here 
          and make unjust complaints at home, he was the last 
          Sessions indicted by the Grand Jury and also tryed and 
          found guilty by a Petty Jury for baratry etc. Will soon 
          transmit the whole proceedings. Continues : Mr. Colebrooke 
          is now proceeding to appeal. I am extremely concern'd that 
          there was a necessity for so much rigour and that if he had 
          been suffer'd to continue his evil practices H.M. might have 
          had a much worse account and perhaps riskt or lost the Colony, 
          shou'd either our neighbours the Spaniards or Pirates have any 
          view to surprize us during our dissentions occasioned by this 
          man, for here has been more contention lately than I knew 
          even whilst I was last here amongst the pirates. And I hope 
          this example will prevent anything like it for the future etc.

          Governor Belcher to Duke of Newcastle. His 
          former letters and the Journal of the Representatives enclosed 
          must make it clear that there is no prospect of anything being 
          done conformable to H.M. Instruction as to fixing a salary. 
          Continues : I am, My Lord Duke, perfectly devoted to H.M. 
          service and honour, and the interest of His British Dominions 
          and these I think not only consistent with but a strengthning 
          of the prosperity of his Plantations, and after this way of 
          thinking I have conducted the administration of the King's 
          Government <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">here</placeName>. And before the year comes about I shall 
          have spent more than the King has required for the support of 
          his Govr., and yet have hardly been able to live as necessarily 
          becomes H.M. Govr. I wou'd therefore with great submission 
          repeat to your Grace that upon a sedate and reasonable review 
          of this matter I can't believe it will be thought justice to me 
          or for the King's honour that I must imploy my life in the 
          King's service and that of his subjects here, to the continual 
          consumption of my own estate, without the least support from 
          the Crown, or from the people here. Yet this has been and is 
          my hard case. I would therefore pray, My Lord Duke, that 
          I may have H.M. leave to sign the inclosed bill etc. (v. 26th 
          April, No. 157 i.) for my support, which your Grace must believe 
          will strengthen me in the service of the Crown, and it will be a 
          punishment upon the people to take their money, " for they 
          really smile at the late Govr's spending 1000£. sterl. of his 
          own estate without receiving a farthing from them " etc. 
          Quotes cases of Lord Bellamont and Mr. Dudley. Concludes : 
          I suppose the great affairs of <placeName ref="#europe" role="secondary">Europe</placeName> have continually ingrost 
          your Grace, and prevent me any answer to the many letters 
          I have wrote etc., yet even this, My Lord Duke, makes this 
          Assembly imagine the King has given over the affair of the 27th Instruction, etc.

          Address of the Council and Representatives of
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts Bay</placeName> to the King. 
          We, your Majesty's loyal and dutiful subjects, in great submission to your Majesty, as 
          well as faithfulness to your subjects of this Province, humbly 
          implore your Majesty's indulgence, and compassionate ear, 
          while we lay before your Majesty our great difficulty by reason 
          of your 27th Instruction to your Governour. We account it 
          our greatest honour, and it is our highest joy, that in the compass 
          of your Majesty's extensive Dominions, none are more firmly 
          and zealously attacht to your Majesties person, and the august 
          House of Hannover, than the whole body of this people : and 
          as we are universally fixed in the principles of loyalty and 
          obedience, and our hearts and affections strongly engaged to 
          your Majesty, by the repeated instances of your paternal care 
          and tenderness towards us ; so particularly by your Majesties 
          distinguishing goodness to this Province, in the appointment 
          of your Majestie's present Governor, and being sincerely desirous 
          to enable and encourage your Majesty's Governour, chearfully to 
          manage the public affairs, your Majesties Council and the House 
          of Representatives, soon after his arival pass'd a bill for his 
          ample and honorable support, and again at the beginning of 
          the present session, they have offered the sum of 5,400£., which 
          sum he has declined accepting on account of your Majesties' 
          Instruction, directing the settlement of a salary on the 
          Governor ; which Instruction, in faithfulness to the rights 
          and privileges of your Majestie's subjects here, we cannot comply 
          with, inasmuch as it would in a great measure alter, if not 
          subvert our happy constitution, wherein it is designed that 
          every part of the Legislature should be induced by interest, 
          as well as duty, to consult an harmony with the others : And 
          we beg leave to observe that the Council, and Representatives 
          have a great dependance on the Governor in many particulars 
          nearly affecting their interest, and that the Governor is under 
          little, or no inducement, as to interest to cultivate a good 
          understanding with them, more especially the House of Repre- 
          sentatives, except that of their granting his support. And 
          while your Majestie's Governor refuses to accept of anything, 
          unless in the way of a fixed salary, and your subjects here, for 
          the reason aforesaid, cannot come into such settlement, the 
          Governor must needs be a sufferer for want of a decent and 
          honorable support. We would therefore most humbly intreat 
          your Majesty, to grant your royal order of leave, that your 
          Governor may receive the sum that has already bin granted, 
          and such further sums as may be granted for his honorable 
          support, suitable to the dignity of his station, when he shall 
          judge them to be so ; which we doubt not this, and all 
          succeeding Assemblys will readily come into, and should they not, 
          we acknowledge your Majesty will have just reason to show your 
          displeasure. Your Majestie's dutiful Council, and Represen- 
          tatives would also humbly beg leave to set forth the great 
          difficulties arising from your Majestie's 30th. Instruction, 
          whereby, should it be comply'd with, the House of Represent- 
          atives would be hindered from passing on those accompts, which 
          they humbly apprehend they have a good right unto, in 
          conjunction with the other branches of the Legislature ; 
          and this is very consistent with the Royal Charter, forasmuch 
          as the Governor, by warrant, with the advice and consent 
          of your Majestie's Council, thereupon issues the money out of 
          the Treasury, which the House of Representatives never pre- 
          tended to intermeddle with, but always supposed, that this 
          of right belonged to your Majestie's Governour and Council, 
          by the Royal Charter, nor has any money ever been drawn 
          out otherwise ; and should this instruction take effect, the 
          House of Representatives, who raise the public money, and 
          whose constituents pay it, would not in many cases, be in any 
          capacity to prevent misapplications of the money, or of 
          obtaining any redress upon undue payments, which it is humbly 
          conceived, would be against common right and equity; for 
          the direction as to a future examination, can serve only to 
          aggravate our distress, but noways helps to refund the money, 
          or gain any relief : there being no possibility of impeachment 
          here, as there is in such cases, in <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">our Mother Countrey</placeName>,  
          before the Right Honorable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in 
          Parliament assembled. Wherefore your Majestie's Council, 
          and House of Representatives would most humbly supplicate 
          your Majesty to withdraw the Instruction aforesaid, so far 
          as it respects the passing accompts. Signed, In the name, and 
          by order of the Council, Josiah Willard, Secretary ; In the 
          name, and by order of the House of Representatives, John 
          Quiney, Speaker. 1 large p. [C.O. 5, 898. No. 87.]</p>

          Governor Belcher to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Since my last (of which you have duplicate here- 
          with) several ships are arriv'd from <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName> without a letter 
          from your Lordships except a few lines purely in favour of the 
          bearer Mr. Reynolds, son to my Lord Bishop of <placeName ref="#en_lincoln" role="descriptive">Lincoln</placeName>, who 
          not finding the collection of <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">N. Hampshire</placeName> to answer his 
          expectations returns by this conveyance. Had he remained, 
          I should have given him all the assistance in my power etc. 
          Continues : H.M. Council and House of Representatives <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">[[ed. of Massachusetts]]</placeName>
          send to their Agents by this conveyance the bill they have past for 
          my support, with their Address to H.M. that I may have leave 
          to take it, and they think they have made a great step, inasmuch 
          as the bill they have now past is after the rate of 3000£ a year 
          from my arrival etc., whereas they us'd to give Govr. Shute 
          no more than 1000£ a year and that was voted only half yearly. 
          I am really of opinion they will not give less for the future, 
          and that they'll do it at the beginning of the year which practice 
          will make the Govr. independent from year to year. Let that 
          be as it will I don't suppose H.M. will withdraw his Instruction 
          etc. Yet I can't see the reason, justice or honour of his Govr. 
          being starv'd or consuming his own substance while he is 
          defending the cause of the Crown etc. Hopes for the royal 
          leave to take his support as the Assembly will give it etc. 
          Continues : As to the 30th Instruction I cannot think it 
          consistent with the King's honour to part with the power 
          reserv'd to the Crown in the Royal Charter, and I really think 
          in that article the House of Representatives thirst after a 
          power that by no means belongs to them, and cou'd they come 
          at it, it wou'd give them such an overbalance of power as 
          wou'd greatly weaken the just authority of H.M. Govr. and 
          Council, and tend to the destruction of the present happy 
          constitution of H.M. Government here. I, therefore, hope 
          your Lordship[s] will rightly represent this matter and prevent 
          the mischief that might be consequent upon their obtaining 
          what they aim at. In my next I shall give my reasons more 
          at large against the House of Representatives having anything 
          to do with passing or paying accompts. The Charter certainly 
          intends that matter shou'd always be with the Govr. and 
          Council. Signed, J. Belcher. Endorsed, Recd. 27th July,

          and Solicitor General on fines and recoveries, which he will 
          communicate, as there shall be occasion, " though I hardly 
          know an instance of any such things being attempted in their 
          Government." Repeats complaint that he has not heard 
          from the Board, which makes the Assembly imagine that the 
          affair of the 27th Instruction is over etc. Repeats part of 
          preceding, the expense of his voyage, commission and 
          supporting the King's honour <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">here</placeName> to make it necessary that

          Concludes : The appointment of the new Lieut. Governor of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">N. Hampshire</placeName> after his so vilely traducing me, has been a 
          great weakning of the King's authority in my hands, nor do I

          and three of Col. Hayes's are embarked for <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName>, 
          where it has been said the runaway negroes have been troublesome, 
          altho' I do not find so much in that, as has been reported, 
          and if it were, as they have 120 miles of mountains to range 
          in, it seems very impracticable to destroy them, the people 
          do not seem to value them, nor do they for the most part seem

          <placeName ref="#jm_portroyal" role="direct">Port Royal</placeName>, 14th Feb., 1731.
          After 7 weeks passage from <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">Gibraltar</placeName>, 
          we arrived here the 7th etc., the regiment in very good health, 
          but begin now to be very sickly. No oven sure was ever so 
          hot. I find it affects my eyes very much, and still have the 
          gravel very much, and my legs swell. We have yet only 14 
          companies landed etc., for I find we are an unexpected guest. 
          The affair of the Blacks I took upon to be quite a Bam, for I 
          can find nobody that has either seen or felt them in a wrathfull 
          manner ; we shall very soon be dispersed about <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Island</placeName>, 
          not a company together, after that I know no business I have 
          here except to sacrifice my health and impoverish my fortune, 
          for realy twice my income will not maintain me as a Collo. 
          ought to live, and I have only the same allowance here as an 
          Ensign which is 20s. pr. week.</p>

        <p>(c) Col. Townsend to Col. Cope. 2nd March, 1731. The 
          accommodations of the two Regiments here, I am affraid will 
          not be very good : at our landing no manner of provision had 
          been made, for I cannot find that anyone expected us, and I 
          am very sure that at present there is no occasion for us : the 
          affair of the rebellious negroes is a triffle, they have force 
          sufficient of their own twenty times told, to put an end to that 
          whenever they have a mind to exert themselves ; nor have 
          they ever been known to appear fifty together in armes etc. 
          In the mean time we are a burthen to <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the Island</placeName> of about 
          15,000£ a year etc. Both regiments are at present ill of feavers 
          and fluxes ; I expect to have bad account of them within these 
          3 months etc. Everything here is excessive dear, twice dearer 
          than at <placeName ref="#gi" role="indirect">Gibraltar</placeName>, no species of money less in value than a 
          royale of plate, which is prodigious hardship upon the soldiers.

          effect as preceding.</p>

        <p>(e) Col. St. Cornwallis to Lord Cornwallis. 5th March, 1731. 
          Most part of the regiment will be dispersed about <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the country</placeName> 
          in many places where there never was a rebellious negro ever 
          heard of, so that two regiments here are no more wanted, except 
          they have a mind to make planters of us, (especially since we are 
          so well with <placeName ref="#es" role="secondary">Spain</placeName>), which I believe some of them have hopes 
          off, for most of them say they are glad we are come because they 
          want white people and not for fear of the blacks, for no one 
          pretends to say that thirty of them were ever seen together etc. 
          This is the most expensive disagreeable place under the sun etc. 
          Our people begin now to be sickly, tho' 'tis at present the 
          healthiest time reckoned etc. Regrets that so many young men 
          should have been sent, when the people were surprized at their 
          coming, and there is now nothing for them to do etc. The 
          troops to be sent to <placeName ref="#jm_portantonio" role="direct">Port Antonio</placeName> are forced to live still upon 
          last provision, for there is at present neither provision or 
          lodging for them, so they keep on board the ships still etc. 
          Concludes : I fancy if you mention this to some of my friends 
          one may have a chance to come home, etc. ; if we stay, they 
          must provide better, but by that time perhaps above half may be dead.</p>

        <p>(f) Same to Same. 10th March, 1731. We have buried the 
          Major of our regiment, and I fear every account will be worse 
          and worse etc. for our men are sent to the quarters in the county, 
          before they have provided barracks etc. Within these two days 
          the inhabitants of the two towns have petitioned to have two 
          companys each, paying their lodging themselves, else they 
          would have been dispersed in like manner. In short the upper 
          sort of people of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">this island</placeName> are such brutes, and the Governour 
          so mild, that we shall suffer most terribly, for as the majority 
          of the last Assembly did everything to vex him, we are sadly 
          used by that means, for they have taken from him the power 
          of quartering the King's troops as they ought to be, for he says 
          he could not help it, and that the Assembly would do it in 
          spight of his teeth etc. We have an account from the party 
          that was sent after the negroes, who say they went to
          <placeName ref="#jm_nannytown" role="direct">their settlement</placeName>, and fought several hours,
          and have burnt their town, but in this terrible engagement they have neither killed 
          nor taken any one of the negroes, so presume those they pretend

        <p>(g) Col. R. Hayes to Major Soule. 11th March, 1731. Both 
          men and officers fall sick very fast. The regiment is dispersed 
          all over <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">the island</placeName>, and no surgeon can go from quarter to 
          quarter to attend them etc. Complains of their very miserable

          pistole here etc. I shall think myself well off if this expedition 
          costs me only 1000£. extraordinary : I have taken a little house 
          here at a place called <placeName ref="#jm_liguanea" role="direct">Ligony</placeName>, the pleasantest part of the island, 
          but no better than an English barn which I am obliged to pay

          and everything dear in proportion etc.</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. We have lately had under 
          consideration three Acts passed in <placeName ref="#us_nj" role="direct">New Jersey</placeName>
          (i) for shortening law-suits etc. (ii) concerning the acknowledging 
          and registering deeds and conveyances of land etc., and 
          (iii) for the frequent meeting and calling of the General Assembly 
          and for the alternate sitting thereof etc. The two first are in 
          substance the same with two Acts passed in 1715, which were 
          afterwards repealed etc. Quote from representation of Jan. 
          10, 1722. Continue : Governors of Plantations are expressly 
          forbid by your Royal Instructions to re-enact any laws which 
          have formerly been repealed by the Crown unless they first 
          receive your Majesty's permission for that purpose, or do insert 
          therein proper clauses declaring them of no effect until they 
          shall be confirmed by your Majesty. As to the last mentioned 
          Act whereby the Assembly is made triennial etc. this is an 
          Act of a very extraordinary nature importing a great change 
          in the constitution of the Province, and if your Majesty should 
          be pleased to allow of any such alteration therein, we cannot 
          but think it very fit that it should take it's rise from the Royal 
          authority wch. first gave being to the form of Government 
          established in New Jersey, and not from the Assembly of that 
          Province. In this Act likewise the suspending clause is omitted, 
          and therefore we humbly lay it before your Majesty, together 
          with the two first, for your disapprobation, all of them having 
          been passed contrary to the Governor's Instructions, the two 
          first being destructive of the jurisdiction of the law courts in 
          New Jersey, and the last of a nature too much encroaching 
          upon the Prerogative of the Crown. [C.O. 5, 996. pp. 270-273.]</p>

          An act of Assembly, 1726, for laying duties on liquors imported, was continued by another 
          act in 1730 till June, 1734. By a clause in the last act no more 
          than half the duty is to be paid for any liquors imported in any 
          ship or vessel wholly and solely belonging to the inhabitants 
          of the said Colony. This clause is not part of the Act of 1726, 
          and such exemption is a very partial proceeding, and is assuming 
          a power of taxing H.M. subjects at large to a higher degree 
          than themselves etc., and a setting up the shipping of that 
          Colony in opposition to, and in great prejudice of the Navigation 
          of this Kingdom, etc. Pray for repeal of latter act, and that 
          the Governor may be restrained from passing any act laying 
          any higher duty on the goods 'or ships of H.M. subjects residing 
          in this Kingdom, than on those belonging to inhabitants of the said Colony.

          <placeName ref="#us_pa_philadelphia" role="direct">Philadelphia</placeName> by a former law

          might prove highly prejudicial to H.M. Revenue in Pennsylvania,

          Governor Worsley to the Duke of Newcastle. As 
          the French in this part of the world seem very intent in making 
          new settlements, I think it my duty to give your Grace an 
          account of the French which have settled at <placeName ref="#lc" role="direct">St. Lucia</placeName> as well 
          as of the English ; By the common computation there are 
          supposed to be three hundred French familys. I can't learn 
          there are above five or six English, it is also computed there's 
          as many French at <placeName ref="#dm" role="direct">Dominico</placeName>, 
          and a great many at <placeName ref="#stvincent" role="direct">St. Vincent's</placeName>, 
          both English and French imploy themselves in raising of stock, 
          sowing corn, and cuting timber ; I don't find that the French 
          have any grant for the land that they take up, but the Governour 
          of <placeName ref="#mq" role="direct">Martinique</placeName> gives them leave to go thither to cut timber 
          and fish, and as they clear away the ground they plant it with 
          corn, and breed great quantities of stock, two or three of the 
          French familys have taken up a great deal of land, and are 
          grown rich ; one or two I am informed applyed to the Governor 
          of Martinique for leave to plant canes, and erect cattle mills 
          to make sugar, but he would not grant it ; the few English 
          that are settled at Sta. Lucia took up the land which they 
          thought convenient for them, and clear the timber which they 
          bring hither for sale and plant corn, and provision to support 
          their negroes which they keep there, as well as for sale here, 
          I know not any of them have any grant or permission from the 
          Duke of Montague, one of them Mr. Batt built a small vessell 
          of about fifteen tons, and applyed to me for a register etc. 
          Refers to former letter. Continues : I have been informed that 
          the Governour of Martinique some times talks of removeing 
          the English from off that Island. On the <placeName ref="#tobago" role="direct">Island of Tobago</placeName> 
          there are no French familys yet settled, but the French go thither 
          to catch turtle, and whilst they stay there make huts to live in, 
          during the time of their fishing, the intention of the French 
          seems to be to people these islands gradually, and as they can 
          live much more hardy then the English, are more able to make 
          such settlements, than they. In November last I advised your 
          Grace that a French guardecote of Martinique had taken some 
          English vessells at Sta. Lucia etc. Encloses the Governor's 
          reply to his letter (encl. i). As the Assembly in their Minutes 
          of 13th Feb. last, mention that I had demanded of them 2000£. 
          and upwards for the pretended repairs of <placeName ref="#bb_governmenthouse" role="direct">Pilgrims House</placeName> 
          I herewith transmit to your Grace their Addresses to me upon 
          that head, by the first of which your Grace will observe that 
          they desired me to lay before them, an account of the charges 
          of the repairs of Pilgrim House which I did in Nov. 1724, and 
          after they had examined the accounts and receipts they 
          addressed me llth of May 1725 in these words, " It appearing 
          to us that your Excellency has laid out, paid, and expended 
          the sum of 2070£. 14s. 1d., current money in and about the 
          necessary repairs of Pilgrim House and buildings " etc. The 
          Assembly mention in the same Minutes that there was but 87 
          barrels of powder in the great Magazine tho' there were wont to 
          be 800. I have transmitted to your Grace their address to me 
          the 12th day of October 1725 by which your Grace will observe, 
          that on account of the ruinous condition of the old magazine, 
          they desire me to appoint a proper place or places for the keeping 
          the said powder, and stores, till the Magazine should be repair'd, 
          or a new one erected, and accordingly I order'd it to be remov'd 
          into the several forts, but I do not so much wonder at this 
          proceeding since they say in the same Minutes that they know 
          that I opposed their Sugar bill at the Board for Trade and that 
          Mr. Sharpe my Agent opposed the same, my letter to your 
          Grace as well as the Board for Trade will justify my conduct 
          upon this head, and as to Mr. Sharpe's opposing the same tis 
          now notoriously known that their Agents in <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName> first 
          employed him, and then dismissed him by orders from hence, 
          and <placeName ref="#ie" role="secondary">Ireland</placeName> and the other Colonies immediately retain'd him. 
          The Council here some time since were very much exasperated 
          at the treatment they met with from the Assembly, who called 
          them incendiaries, and it might have been carried to great 
          lengths had I not kept my temper, and conducted it calmly, 
          but at present <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">the Island</placeName> is very quiet, etc.

        <p>Findings of the Admiralty Court, <placeName ref="#mq" role="direct">Martinique</placeName>, (i) 
          The English bark Anne of Dartmouth (Capt. Shepheard) 
          was released with costs and damages from day of 
          seizure, it being proved that she had loaded and 
          cleared from <placeName ref="#bb" role="direct">Barbados</placeName> and had only been 8 hours at 
          anchor at <placeName ref="#lc" role="direct">Sta. Lucia</placeName>, (ii) The bark Jeanne Marie 
          d'Amboye was released, with costs and damages 
          against the Domaine. The master had no papers 
          to prove that he had really loaded at the island of 
          Iscap [sic], so that it appears he was generously treated 
          on the assumption that he had been forced to put in 
          at Sta. Lucia, (iii) The bark Two Brothers had no 
          papers on board and was condemned and confiscated 
          with her boat for trading at Sta. Lucia, her crew having 
          been rowing a boat laden with a keg of brandy, (iv) 
          The Good Intention was likewise confiscated, it being 
          proved that she had come from Barbados in ballast 
          and being found laden with produce of the French 
          islands, (v) The Fortune was confiscated, for having 
          no papers and trading at Sta. Lucia, being laden with 
          goods admitted by the Captain, Isaac Royal, he had 
          taken off Sta. Lucia. Copy. French. 1 1/2 pp.</p>

          Governor Rogers to Mr. Delafaye. Refers to letter 
          of 10th June. Continues : The vessel by which this goes 
          (in order to conceal the design of her proceeding to <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>) 
          is cleared out for <placeName ref="#bm" role="indirect">Bermuda</placeName> to prevent my sending any letters 
          in her, she being hired by Mr. Colebrooke, tho' in other person's 
          name, as I apprehend to carry hence all that he can invent, 
          or prevail on those of the party he has made here, to joyn in, 
          by way of complaint against me, I find there is a necessity for 
          my taking the liberty of directing this packet to you, for a 
          further security of its being conveyed and delivered, which I 
          hope you will be pleased to excuse. The prosecuting Mr. 
          Colebrooke I humbly hope will be approved, and convince 
          the Ministry what a mischievous person he has been, and how 
          much he has obstructed the welfare and peopling of <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">this Colony</placeName>. 
          For my part, I assure you, Sir, I never had so much uneasiness 
          in my life as he has occasion'd me here ; for instead of applying 
          himself to the improvemt. and encouragemt. of trade (which 
          was what he came abroad for) he together with four or five 
          more who were his companions and dependents made it their 
          whole study to injure and distress me by continually 
          endeavouring to stirr up sedition and animosity in the minds 
          of the people, and discontent and mutiny in the garrison which 
          he attempted by all the methods he could think on etc. Requests 
          that he may be given time to answer any misrepresentations 
          etc. Is doing all he can for Mr. Bonnet. He has lately written 
          to " the good Lord Townshend " etc. P.S. Not being certain 
          that this vessel goes for London, will not venture by it what he 
          intended to the Duke of Newcastle and Board of Trade etc.

          Council of Trade and Plantations to Governor Rogers. 
          Acknowledge letters etc. of Oct. and Feb. 10th last. Have 
          referred the acts enclosed to Mr. Fane and will take them into 
          consideration on receiving his report. Referring to Capt. 
          Phenney's bond (v. Feb. 10th and June 9th), " we are of opinion 
          that the Assembly should not have put him under so great a 
          difficulty, and therefore we have propos'd to H.M. that this 
          bond should be cancelled." Continue : We observe by the 
          Minutes of Assembly of 1st Oct. last, that upon a message 
          from them, desiring that the Council books may be laid before 
          the Assembly, you gave directions accordingly. Upon this 
          occasion, we must observe to you, that as by your Instructions 
          all laws to be pass'd by you are required to be consistent with, 
          and as near as may be consonant to the laws of this Kingdom ; 
          so it would be proper that the proceedings of the Assembly 
          also should resemble those of the Parliament of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>, 
          so far as the circumstances of <placeName ref="#bs" role="direct">the Colony</placeName> and your Instructions 
          will permit. And as the Council with you as in all ye other 
          Colonies abroad have two capacitys very different in their 
          nature, and design, so their proceedings as the King's Council 
          in political matters should be kept entirely distinct from those 
          wherein they act as one branch of the Legislature, and ought 
          to be fairly entered in separate books. It would be a pretty 
          difficult task to lay down a plan for the proceedings of your 
          Assembly in future times, or to allot the particular limits to be 
          observed by them. But in general we may observe to you 
          that the Constitution of <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName> owes its preservation very 
          much to the maintaining of an equal ballance between the three 
          branches of the Legislature, and that the more distinct they 
          are kept from each other, the likelier they will be to agree, 
          and the longer they will be likely to last. By the Minutes of 
          the sixth of the same month, we find the Assembly desir'd 
          Capt. Phenney's Instructions might be laid before them ; But 
          as the Instructions, which H.M. thinks proper to give to his 
          Governors, are only for their conduct and guidance, you will 
          be the proper judge which of them, and when they ought 
          to be communicated to the Assembly. By the Minutes of 12th 
          May, 1730, the Assembly seems to have been prorogued by the 
          Governor and Council, but as this does not appear to be the 
          case by the Minutes of Council of the same date, you must 
          take care to have this amended in the Journals of the Assembly, 
          and the rather because the Council cannot claim any right of 
          proroguing the Assembly, and altho' this is a mistake, yet some 
          time or other, if not corrected, it may be made a precedent 
          to claim a power never yet granted to any of H.M. Councils 
          abroad. We have consider'd what you write concerning Mr. 
          White and Mr. Jenner, the former of which you have 
          suspended from his seat in Council. Upon this occasion, 
          we must take notice that you did very wrong to desire any 
          Member of the Council to retire at a time that you had some- 
          thing to propose to the remaining Members, for everyone of 
          the Council has an undoubted right to sit and debate at that 
          Board, until H.M. shall think fit to displace him from thence, 
          or he be suspended for sufficient reasons, in the manner 
          prescribed by your Instructions ; and if after this usage, Mr. 
          White has thought himself so much slighted, as to refuse to 
          return to the Council, when you sent for him, we do not think 
          this is a sufficient reason for suspending him. [C.O. 24, 1. pp. 201-206.]</p>

        <p>Case of Francis Williams of <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName>. John Williams, 
          his father, being a free negro, and by his great fidelity and 
          industry having acquired a considerable estate, he obtained 
          an act, afterwards approved by the Crown, whereby it was 
          enacted that no slave should be evidence against him, and that 
          the said John Williams should henceforth be tryed by a jury 
          according to the known laws, customs and priviledges of English- 
          men and the practise and usage of that island. John Williams 
          married with Dorothy a free negro by whom he had three 
          children all sons whom he educated in the Protestant religion 
          according to the Church of England and also gave 'em all other 
          suitable education in a liberal manner. Another act was passed 
          in Jamaica to give the like priviledges to the wife and children 
          as to John Williams etc. But by an act passed 28th March 
          for the better regulating slaves etc., severe clauses are laid on all 
          free negroes in general ; (i) That all free negroes shall in 
          default of every free negroe's appearing at the vestry of the 
          parish where he resides when thereunto summoned by a warrant 
          from any J.P. in such parish in order to having their own and 
          the names, ages and sexes of their wives children registred, 
          such free negro for the first offence is to forfeit 10£., for the 
          second 20£., and for the third his or her freedom and to be 
          transported etc., on conviction before any two Justices of the 
          Peace and three Freeholders. This clause is apprehended to 
          be very improper and too much for the Assembly to take upon 
          them to enact, as it directly takes away those libertys and 
          priviledges given the family of the Williams by the several 
          acts beforementioned etc. Besides to lodge such an extensive 
          power in any two Justices and three Freeholders is much too 
          large etc. Loss of freedom will of course carry with it loss of 
          estate, which in the family of the Williams amounts to above 
          20,000£., which is too great a temptation to have a nefarious 
          use made of this and the following clause ; (ii) That all free 
          negroes from the age of 15 to 60 shall be obliged on every 
          summons or order of every custos next magistrate collector 
          or next commanding officer in each of the parishes to appear 
          when and where directed in order to be sent out in any party 
          that shall be ordered out in pursuit of the rebellious and run- 
          away negroes, and every free negroe who shall neglect to appear 
          or refuse to go out in such party shall for the first offence be 
          committed to jail for six months without bail or mainprize, for 
          the second suffer 12 months imprisonment and for the third 
          lose his freedom. This clause is likewise thought to be in 
          contradiction to the said acts, no such penaltys being inflicted 
          on any white men, besides this clause hath no proviso in case 
          of sickness nor gives no permission for sending in their places 
          one or more hunters or woodmen properer for the service than 
          persons educated in <placeName ref="#en" role="secondary">England</placeName> as the free negroes are to attend 
          partys in woods and mountains almost unaccessible. It is 
          also against the said acts, and also exceeding severe not to allow 
          any bail or mainprize for a family who are in possession of 
          several acts directing they shall in all cases be tryed as Englishmen 
          and who are by all the acts of Jamaica bailable on these 
          occasions and to punish or free people with imprisonment and 
          loss of freedom for not appearing on those occasions in person 
          when it may not be in his power and when he is ready 
          to substitute one or more persons etc. is surely too hard and 
          unreasonable etc., especially as the act has no proviso for women 
          or children or such as are sick or absent, (iii) It is also enacted 
          that no free negroe shall after the 2nd April 1730 wear any 
          sword, cutlass, pistols or other arms or weapons whatsoever, 
          excepting whilst on duty on the publick service or in the service 
          of their employer under the penalty of 5£. (hunters and fowlers 
          excepted), and that no free negroe do presume to buy or indent 
          any white men under the penalty of 50£. This clause is directly 
          levelled at Mr. Francis Williams, it being notorious that no 
          free negroes wear a sword and pistols besides himself and 
          what justifies him therein is not only the largeness of his estate 
          but the liability of his being assaulted by everyone whom he 
          sues for the recovery of his own. This clause may also be a 
          temptation to ill-disposed people to spirit up the minds of their 
          ignorant slaves to assault and way-lay Mr. Williams, and it is 
          observable this law does not forbid the slaves to wear swords 
          or pistols. Why should the free negroes then be prohibited ? 
          etc. The latter part of this clause is still more extraordinary 
          etc., since by a late act passed in Jamaica every planter is 
          obliged to have one white man-servant to every 30 negroes 
          under the penalty of 26£. 10s. per annum, so that this present 
          act etc. lays every free negroe who hath a plantation under a 
          necessity of incurring the penaltys of one or other of these acts 
          etc. (iv) It is also enacted that no free Indian shall work in 
          any sort of silver or gold or keep any shop for the sale of any 
          gold wares or merchandize or the produce of this island under 
          the penalty of 50£. for every offence. This clause is also thought 
          exceeding severe, for as the laws of Jamaica always heretofore 
          indulged free negroes with buying houses and settling plan- 
          tations, so it would certainly be very hard should they be 
          now debarred selling the produce of these plantations, and 
          when that produce is converted into money should be still 
          debarred from investing that money in any goods, wares or 
          merchandizes for the further enlarging their fortunes under 
          such severe penaltys as are laid by this act. And there really 
          seems a plain intention to oppress the free negroes by comparing 
          these two last clauses together which amount to this vizt., 
          they shall have neither bought nor indented servants to save 
          paying the penalty of 26£. 10s., they shall neither buy nor sell 
          any wares or produce etc., to pay such penalty and yet they 
          must pay etc. Prays that the Act may be repealed. Endorsed,

        <p>Governor Burrington to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Abstract. Transmits report upon the state of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="direct">the Province</placeName>. Has acted in everything to the best of his 
          capacity. Has been entirely left to himself since he entered 
          upon the country's business and instead of help from the Council, 
          they are a weight upon him. " There has been no foolery or 
          vilany sett on foot that they are not concerned inn, which has 
          increased since John Mongomery, the Attorney General, arrived." 
          Has the whole force of his wisdom and three others to guard 
          against. If he is wanting in his report, it is owing to their 
          conduct, although he has endeavoured to serve. When he 
          mentions the Council, he does not mean all, but complains of 
          three principally, vizt., Mr. Ashe, Mr. Porter, whom he has 
          refused to screen from several prosecutions for his violent and 
          unlawful proceedings in the Court of Admiralty of which he is 
          Judge, and Mr. Smith the Chief Justice, a weak hasty young 
          man drunk from morning till night, set on work by the other 
          two and some of the managers in the Assembly. He has resigned 
          his seat at the Council Board, and is reported to be going home 
          with complaints against the Governor. His own actions will 
          speak for themselves, and he only demands not to be censured 
          unheard etc. Printed, N.C. Col. Rec. iii, 140. Signed, Geo.

        <p>Governor Burrington's Report to the Council of Trade 
          and Plantations. Abstract. He arrived 25th Feb. 
          to find <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="direct">the country</placeName> in the greatest confusion, " the 
          Government sunk so low that neither peace or order 
          subsisted, the General Court suppressed, the Council 
          set aside a year and a half, and some of the Precinct 
          Courts fallen. The Admiralty Court having no 
          restraint began to draw all manner of business there, 
          and proceeded in such an extraordinary manner as 
          occasioned a general discontent and ferment among 
          the people " etc. The Judge of that Court the chief 
          actor in running the country into disorders. The late 
          Governor being a very weak man was too easily put 
          upon rash measures that have caused so many heats 
          and divisions. Has done his best to allay them. 
          Encloses addresses by the Grand Jury to H.M. and 
          himself, gratefully acknowledging the same. Called 
          a new Assembly which sat for 5 weeks from 13th April, 
          but was then obliged to part with them, finding that 
          the longer they sat the more their heats encreased, 
          and less inclination to observe H.M. Instructions which 
          he laid before them. On H.M. 19th Instruction a bill 
          was formed for an act about fees and quit-rents. But 
          instead of complying with H.M. instructions about 
          the payment of these in Proclamation money, they 
          pretended to allow the payment in that money or bills 
          at four to one discount, but then endeavoured to reduce 
          the fees four times as low as they were before, and then 
          took advantage of a division in the Council and the 
          misbehaviour of the Chief Justice etc., so that he was 
          obliged to prorogue them. They also evaded that 
          part of the Instruction that required registering of 
          lands, which is necessary for getting H.M. rent-roll, 
          for want of which and of power in the Lords Proprietors 
          there has been great difficulty hitherto in the collecting. 
          There being no Receiver General there, the collection 
          of the revenue is like to be more difficult. It will 
          require an officer inmediately commissioned, and not 
          a Deputy as is now designed. In respect to the payment
          of quit-rents, they had ingeniously contrived 
          (under pretence of not being able to pay this year) 
          that it would be near two years before rents should be 
          paid, and then the bill added they might be paid in 
          tobacco or rice at 11s. per cwt. as an equivalent for 
          Proclamation money, tho' neither are worth near so 
          much. He could get no advice from the Council as 
          to whether any equivalent at all could be taken instead 
          of money, and now asks for H.M. directions. Money 
          " is hardly to be raised in that Government, it being
          affirmed that there has not been cash eneugh at one 
          time here to pay a year's rents, and the people have 
          another plea that the Grand Deed to the inhabitants 
          of Albemarle (the name this Government was then 
          called) in 1668, under which most part of the lands 
          are held, grants the lands to them on the same terms 
          as in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="indirect">Virginia</placeName> where the rents are paid in tobacco or 
          money at the choice of the parties, and it is submitted 
          whither it would not be a means of putting people on 
          raising tobacco and thereby increase our European 
          trade that so much wants encouragement " etc. In 
          reply to xxth Instruction recounts history of the 
          paper bills of credit. All the old bills have been called 
          in and those now subsisting are by a pretended act made 
          in Nov., 1729 after the King had purchased etc. By 
          it the bills let out at loan on land security are re-issued 
          as soon as paid in, and therefore made perpetual. For 
          want of care in the valuation of the lands mortgaged, 
          it is said there has been a great deal of fraud. 
          Compares it with the Virginia currency and  
          Proclamation money. The credit of the bills is much lower 
          than stated in the Act and is declining from the 
          breaking up of this Assembly. It is held by many 
          that the act itself is void, as being made and ratifyed 
          in the name of the Lords Proprietors when they had 
          surrendered to the Crown, and also because the 
          Government were not empowered to make such an 
          act, without a clause therein not to be of force, till 
          their assent was had etc. The present Assembly, 
          however, are of opinion that the laws made in 1729 
          are not void, or at least ought to remain in force till 
          H.M. pleasure be known therein (v. Journal, 28th April) 
          the Bills have been found so necessary in facilitating 
          payments, defraying contingent charges of the Government
          and as a medium of trade, that the destroying 
          them wholly would be a great loss to the country. In 
          obedience to Instruction xxv, sends home all the 
          laws in force. He would have had them revised, if the 
          Assembly would have done business. Some are 
          obsolete, others need alterations, but in general they are 
          a body of laws well adapted to the place etc. Forbears 
          erecting a Court of Exchequer till he sees its necessity. 
          At present there is no one capable of trying a cause in 
          one. Prays one may be sent. On enquiry into complaints 
          by and against Sir R. Everard, as directed by 
          the 41st Instruction, he was not candidly dealt by the 
          Council. At length they gave their opinion that there 
          was nothing material in the complaint against him, 
          only the words spoken against H.M., which were to be 
          proved by Collector Gale now in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, and Col. 
          Thomas Harvey some time dead. The Secretary was 
          by the unanimous opinion of the Board discharged 
          from Sir Richard's complaints against him. Mr. 
          Porter having complained against several persons for 
          an intended riot and combination to assassinate him, 
          he was promised a day for hearing, if he would draw 
          the complaint in form etc., but he having offered 
          nothing further, concludes he has dropped it. Thinks 
          there was no such riot or design intended. Has 
          received a complaint against the said Judge of the 
          Admiralty for many illegal and arbitrary proceedings 
          in that Court, praying for his suspension. This he 
          laid before the Council to be proceeded upon. Mr. 
          Porter has hitherto made no reply. He laid the XLIInd 
          Instruction before the Assembly and recommended 
          it to them in his Speech, but nothing was done by 
          them. To that part which relates to persons holding 
          greater quantities of lands than their grants express, 
          it was urged that they had a law already about 
          resurveys in such cases. Asks for a form of patents. 
          Thinks 50 acres to each person in a family too little 
          to produce much pitch and tar, because 1000 acres 
          of pine land of which 19 parts in 20 of the country 
          consists, will hardly imploy one slave, so that, if not 
          altered, this regulation will prove very detrimental to 
          the revenue. In some places there are large plains 
          called Savannas, these are boggy and as bad lands 
          as the moors in the North. The pine lands are chiefly 
          sandy barrens as improper for littage as the Savannas.
          " If people have so little land it will be a very long 
          time before all the country is settled, and if men are 
          obliged to live so near one another they must make 
          their own apparrel and hous'hould goods, because 
          they cannot raise stock to purchase them brought 
          from England. It is by breeding horses, hoggs and 
          cattle, that people without slaves gain substance here 
          at first, not by their labour. If but one half of the 
          Province is inhabited, the produce of cattle etc will 
          be but half " etc. As to any grants of land made 
          since H.M. purchase, he has been moved by the 
          Assembly to join in an address to H.M. to have them 
          all confirmed, which he declined, but promised to 
          represent the matter to the Lords of Trade fully. 
          States case. Instruction XLIII required that in all 
          future grants the quit-rents should be 4s. But the 
          people urge that they have an undoubted right by the 
          Grand Deed upon the Lords Proprietors to hold their 
          lands on the same tennure as in Virginia, which is at 
          2s. per hundred etc. If this Instruction be continued, 
          it will prevent them taking up land. In reply to 
          XLVIth Instruction, gives an account of the Courts 
          and Jurisdictions established. Desires directions as 
          to the power of Assistant Judges, a great dispute 
          having been raised by the Chief Justice and his two 
          allies in the Council, who assert that the Assistants 
          have no judicial power, but sit only as supporters. 
          In that case no gentleman will accompany the Chief 
          Justice on the Bench, and it will be erecting a single 
          Judge of the Court of Common Pleas etc. As to the 
          XLVIIth Instruction, he never heard that any officers 
          in North Carolina held places under the Proprietors 
          for life, but only during their pleasure, which are all 
          now superceeded. The Assembly have always usurped 
          power. Instances their choosing a Public Treasurer, 
          now Edward Moseley, Speaker and Manager of the 
          Assembly. Refers to debate in Journal. By the 
          Assembly in 1729 a pretended act was passed constituting 
          eleven precinct Treasurers, who were all in 
          the Assembly and as they have the disposition of the 
          publick money will be constantly chosen, which forms 
          so great a party that they can lead the Assembly as 
          they please. Is sure it will be for H.M. service and the 
          quiet of the Province that a Treasurer for this Government
          be appointed by the Lords of the Treasury. In 
          accordance with Instructions XLVIII and XIX, he 
          ordered with the assent of the Council that all fees as 
          they then stood should be received till further regu- 
          lation, but they should not be compelled to receive them 
          in Province bills unless at four for one according to 
          the estimate made of them with respect to silver in 
          the pretended act. Recounts dispute with Assembly 
          on this matter. The Assembly was prorogued to 
          6th Sept., when by a law here the biennial election 
          comes on. By the LVIth Instruction he is commanded 
          to appoint Courts of Oyer and Terminer yearly, at a 
          charge not exceeding 100£. each session. If this money 
          is to be paid in bills it will not suffice. Asks for 
          directions. As to LXIst Instruction, there is a law 
          concerning juries already, though it has certain incon- 
          veniences. The LXIIIrd Instruction he recommended 
          to the Assembly in vain. His LXIXth Instruction 
          to countenance H.M. officers he strictly obeys, though 
          it has made enemies of several of his former friends. 
          The LXXVth and LXXVIth instructions, concerning 
          Churches, he laid before the Assembly, but could not 
          observe much sense of religion among them, or that 
          any notice was taken. The country has no orthodox 
          Minister legally settled, those formerly here generally 
          gave offence by their vicious lives. Each Parish has 
          churchwardens and a vestry empowered to raise money 
          by a poll-tax, which is applied to maintaining the poor 
          or paying a minister to come out from Virginia, or 
          readers etc. Several parishes by contributions have 
          built chapels etc. LXXVth Instruction. There are 
          already good and wholesome laws for punishing vice, 
          but better framed than executed. Will recommend 
          establishment of schools, so much wanted, when the 
          Assembly is disposed to do business. As for laws for 
          the conversion of Negroes and Indians, does not expect 
          much will be done, when so little regard is had to 
          promote publick worship. LXXVIth Instruction. 
          The Indians of late years are much diminished. There 
          are six nations amongst them, who all live within the 
          English settlements having land assigned them and 
          choosing places most secure from attacks of foreign 
          Indians. These are the Hatteras, Maremuskeets, 
          Potaskites, Chowans, Meherrins and Tuscarora. None 
          exceeds 20 families, except the Tuscaroras who now 
          consist of 200 fighting men etc. There was lately 
          complaints from the Government of <placeName ref="#us_nc" role="direct">S. Carolina</placeName> of 
          injuries done the white people by the latter, but they 
          denying the facts are threatened by that Government 
          with a war from the Cherokees and Cataubas. The 
          King of the Tuscaroras is now with him to make some 
          proposals, that the white people of S. Carolina may 
          not come against him, because he says it may bring 
          on a war with the English in general. He has only 
          one Councillor to consult with, the rest being out of 
          the Province or at a very great distance ; will be 
          obliged to fill up some of the vacancies. LXXVIIIth 
          Instruction. There is a law for registering births and 
          burials in each parish, but very little notice taken of 
          it. There are no forts, garrisons, magazines or public 
          arms or ammunition, CIII. Is procuring a map to 
          be done very accurately. CIV. As to boundaries, 
          a river boundary would be much more certain and less 
          expensive than a land line etc. The <placeName ref="#rv_santee" role="boundary">Santee river</placeName> was 
          the ancient boundary etc. CV. The duties are 
          charged on imports or exports, except a powder duty, 
          at first intended for pilotage and buoying out the 
          inlets. Some attempts were made, but of late shamefully
          neglected. The money is chiefly used for paying 
          the Assembly men, who have received 10s. a day 
          travelling expences. There is no law for their being 
          paid, so he refused to sign a warrant at their late 
          prorogation. Hopes for the future they will bear          
          their own charges in North as they do in South Carolina. 
          There are no duties on anything, and only a poll tax 
          of 5s. each tythable bill money (and that by the 
          pretended act in 1729 abolished) and a parish tax to 
          be assessed by the Vestry not exceeding 5s. per poll, 
          so that the whole tax cannot amount to above 10/s. 
          a poll for rateable persons in bill money not exceeding 
          1s. 6d. sterling, and though the people are thus free 
          from taxes or impositions beyond any people in all 
          H.M. Dominions, they seem uneasy that the King's 
          rents should be demanded in Proclamation money or 
          anything else but bills, CVI, CVII. The African 
          Company's trade here has hitherto been small. All 
          encouragement will be given to it. Will endeavour to 
          restore the country to order : it is capable of being 
          made a flourishing colony, and yearly will increase by 
          the coming of people from the Northern settlements 
          etc. The good lands lying commodiously are long 
          since patented, the remainder, the greatest part of 
          the country, are far from navigable waters. For the 
          increase of H.M. revenue and good of the Province, 
          hopes to receive an order to grant lands at 2s. (instead 
          of 4s.) per 100 acres. Has signed but one warrant for 
          taking up lands since his arrival. The trade of this 
          Government is now very miserable, except at <placeName ref="#rv_capefear" role="indirect">Cape Fear River</placeName>.
          The merchants on <placeName ref="#rv_james" role="indirect">James River</placeName> in Virginia supply 
          most of the inhabitants on the north side of <placeName ref="#by_albemarle" role="indirect">Albemarle Sound</placeName> 
          and <placeName ref="#rv_roanoke" role="indirect">Roanoke River</placeName> with 
          British commodities at unreasonable rates, being 
          brought in by land or in little canoos in small 
          quantitys ; the people of <placeName ref="#us_ne" role="indirect">New England</placeName> send in sorry 
          sloops which sail from river to river with West India 
          goods and salt and carry away such things as cannot 
          conveniently be transported into Virginia. The only 
          method to put the traffic in a right way and make the 
          trade advantageous to Great Britain is to settle a 
          Custom House on <placeName ref="#is_ocracoke" role="direct">Ocacock Island</placeName>, where there is a 
          good harbour for vessels of 300 tons etc., to be a port

          Minutes of Privy Council.
          Capt. Dent and Mr. Bladen were called in (v. 2nd June). 
          Capt Dent was asked as to the health and condition of the 2 Regimts. 
          [in <placeName ref="#jm" role="direct">Jamaica</placeName>], wch. he said was very bad, but he beleived 
          it was greatly oweing to their own irregularity. That ye regimts. 
          were dispersed all over ye island, some att 100 miles distance. 
          As to ye use of ym for destroying the rebellious negroes, he thinks 
          they may be of use to hinder them coming down, etc. but cannot 
          follow them into ye mountains and destroy them there, wch. he 
          thinks was the original design of sending them thither. He 
          thinks the rebellious negroes more insolent and dangerous than 
          formerly. He does not think, in case of any attempt upon ye 
          island, they cd. be of any use to ye enimy except that of being 
          guides. He was asked whether he thought these regimts. 
          necessary for ye defence of ye island in case of an attempt from 
          an enemy. He says ye island is in a very defenceless condition, 
          and can hardly [?] raise 1000 white men, that as the Regt. are 
          dispersed it would be 8 or 10 days before they can be gott 
          together, and yt. must be done by shipping.      
          Mr. Bladen agreed wt. Capt. Dent in opinion as to ye 
          little service the 2 Regiments would be for ye suppressing 
          ye rebellious negroes, or following them into ye mountains. 
          That his opinion was, and that of ye Board of Trade, yt. 2 
          Independant Comps. should be compleated out of ye Regiments, 
          and then one or both of them might be brought home. Upon 
          the variety of opinions relating to ye necessity or use yt. these 
          two Regimts. may be of att Jamaica, their Lordships determined 
          to referr this matter to ye Board of Trade for their opinion 
          thereupon. The Duke of Newcastle's letter (" my letter ") 
          to Lord Waldegrave of the 1st was read ; and it was proposed 
          that my Lord Lieutenant of <placeName ref="#ie" role="descriptive">Ireland</placeName> should send directions for 
          the regiments to be in a readiness, in case there should be 
          occasion for them ; and also to write to Mr, Keene to acquaint
          him with what has been done here ; and that it shall make no 
          alteration as to the sending the fleet, which shall be there at 
          the time proposed. (Original draft of transactions of the Privy

          Acknowledge letters etc. of 5th and 10th Dec. 1730, 13th and 
          25th Jan., 1st March, 5th and 26th April 1731, etc. Continue : If 
          you have not heard from us, in return thereto, it has been 
          because till yor. last letters we did entertain some hopes, that the 
          Assembly might have been prevailed on, to comply with H.M. 
          Instructions relating to your salary. But since you now tell 
          us, in your two last letters, that you have no prospect of that 
          kind, since you have neither come <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">home</placeName> yourself, nor deputed 
          any person according to your Instruction, to lay an acct. of this 
          matter before H.M., we shall take an oppertunity of doing it 
          ourselves, and as soon as we shall know H.M. pleasure thereon, 
          you may expect to hear again from us ; In ye mean time we 
          must acquaint you ; that we have reported our opinion upon 
          ye bill consented to by the Council and Assembly for settling 
          yor. salary, which we can by no means think a compliance, 
          either with the letter or intent of H.M. Instruction. In answer 
          to that part of your last letter, wherein you mention the petition, 
          or memorial from the House of Representatives to H.M. against 
          three of his Royal Instructions to you ; we must observe that 
          the people have an undoubted right of addressing the Crown 
          directly without any prior application to ye Governor, if they 
          think fit to take that method, tho', the more decent way would 
          be to desire their Governor to transmit their Address. We 
          observe what you have wrote in your justification, against what 
          you suppose must have been insinuated against you by Colo. 
          Dunbar ; but we are of opinion, that he had sufficient grounds 
          for his apprehensions, and he would have been wanting in his 
          duty, if he had not sent us such informations as he had receiv'd 
          upon that subject. We thought it would be for H.M. service, 
          that this gentleman should be appointed his Lt. Governor of 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName>, to encrease his authority as Surveyor of ye 
          Woods, and upon our recommendation, H.M. has been pleased 
          to appoint him accordingly. But we presume he will always 
          pay you that regard that is due to his superior officer, and we 
          doubt not but you will treat him as a gentleman that bears 
          H.M. Commission as Lt. Governor. We have considered the 
          New Hampshire bill for emitting 6000£. in bills of credit etc., but 
          we can by no means advise H.M. to allow you to pass any such 
          bill, as it must in consequence lower the credit of the Province, 
          whereby their trade must greatly suffer ; however that we may 
          be the better able to judge of ye state of ye Province with respect 
          to their paper currency, we desire you will send us an acct. of 
          ye paper money now current there ; and what fund there is for 
          sinking the same ? How it has been apply'd and what discount 
          their bills are now lyable to ? We observe what you write 
          concerning ye Council of New Hampshire, but it will be time 
          enough to consider of ye persons you propose, when we shall be 
          informed whose vacancies you propose they should supply. In 
          your letter of 25th Jan. you mention seven gentlemen of whom 
          you say the Council consists ; but you do not inform us, whether 
          ye others who were named in yor. Instructions are dead, or 
          whether they decline acting. We therefore desire you will 
          send us a more perfect acct. etc. [C.O. 5, 916. pp. 419-421.]</p>

          Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. An act was lately pass'd
          in your Majesty's Colony of <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">Virginia</placeName> for 
          continuing part of an act for laying a duty on liquors with some 
          alterations and amendments. This act continues the duty of 
          3d. per gall, on wine, rum, brandy and other distilled spirits 
          imported into that Colony, laid by a former law for 5 years 
          ending the 10th of the last month, for three years longer. But 
          there is an additional clause, which provides that only one half 
          of the said duty of 3d. per gallion shall for the future be levied 
          upon any liquors imported by ships wholly and solely belonging 
          to the inhabitants of Virigina. Against this clause we have 
          received objections from several merchts. engaged in the trade 
          of Virginia, and as it appears to be a very partial stipulation 
          in favour of the inhabitants of that Colony, manifestly design'd 
          to encourage their Trade and Navigation in opposition and to 
          the detriment of ye shipping and commerce of <placeName ref="#gb" role="direct">Great Britain</placeName>, 
          we therefore humbly beg leave to lay the same before your 
          Majesty for your disapprobation. [C.O. 5, 1366. pp. 75, 76.]</p>

          day of importation is paid or secured to be paid before 
          any sale is made thereof, or any certainty that negroes 
          will be sold but at such prices as the planter shall

          285. i. Address of the House of Representatives of
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts Bay</placeName> to the King. 
          We your Majesty's most loyall and dutifull subjects, having full confidence 
          in your Majesty's paternal care and tenderness, 
          humbly beg leave to lay open to your wise and 
          compassionate consideration the difficultys and distresses 
          your Majesty's subjects in this Province labour under 
          by reason of certain Instructions given your Majesty's 
          Governor, more particularly your Majty. sixteenth 
          Instruction directing the Governor to consent to the 
          emission of 30,000£. only in bills of credit to be called 
          in so suddenly that no more than that sum should 
          pass at one and the same time, which Instruction if 
          complyed with would render it next to impossible 
          to support the Government here, inasmuch as every 
          year for about eleven years to come is loaded with 
          great and heavy debts to be paid for the discharge of 
          such sums as have been expended in the late charge- 
          able and distressing Indian warr in defence of your 
          Majesty's territorys and dutiful subjects here, and 
          could not possibly be defrayed in the respective years 
          wherein such debts were contracted, and while the 
          Province is struggling to discharge the former debts 
          should they be prohibited the emission of any bills to 
          pay the standing charge of the Province, and the 
          laying the funds for drawing them in on any of those 
          years that are as yet burthened with no debt they 
          must necessarily pay about 50,000£. pr. ann., a thing 
          impracticable, especially after a few years when the 
          bills of credit will be mainly called in, which are the 
          only currency whereby publick or private debts can 
          be discharged. Whereas if the Government was 
          permitted to emitt bills of credit to be laid on some 
          future unincumbred years, to pay such part of the 
          annuall charge of the Province as the Government 
          are not at present able to defray besides the old debts, 
          they would in about eleven years intirely discharge 
          the old debts and have only some smaller sums to pay 
          for some part of the standing charge of the Province 
          during the eleven years aforesaid, which in some few 
          years further by the blessing of God on the industry 
          of your subjects here might be discharged and this 
          Province become free from debt. And your Majesty's 
          loyall and dutiful subjects are the more apprehensive 
          of difficulty by this Instruction, because H.E. the 
          Govr. in obedience to your Majesty's commands, 
          and for the good and safety of the Province has directed 
          a survey of your Majesty's forts and garrisons, here, 
          which are very much run to dispare [sic], the necessary 
          reparations whereof, it is supposed may cost 20 or 
          30,000£. This House are also under great concern that 
          they are not able in faithfulness to the rights and 
          privileges of your people here to comply with your 
          Majesty's 27th Instruction directing the settlement 
          of a salary on the Governor for the time being by 
          reason (as we humbly conceive) that the frame and 
          constitution of our Government would thereby be 
          very much altered if not subverted and our circumstances 
          be farr different from those of English subjects ; 
          there would be no ballance of power in the severall 
          branches of the Legislature, the House of Representatives 
          would depend on the Governor for many 
          things of the greatest consequence to them and the 
          interest and safety of the people they represent, 
          while no obligation in those points will lie on the 
          Governor. This notwithstanding your Majesty's loyal 
          subjects are willing and desirous to grant from time 
          to time an ample and honourable support to your 
          Majesty's Governors suitable to the dignity of their 
          station, and accordingly soon after his Excellency's 
          arrival a grant of 3000£. past the House of Representatives, 
          but was non-concurr'd by your Majesty's 
          Council, after which an act past making a further 
          offer for H.E.'s ample and honourable support, and 
          being concurred by the Council was laid before H.E. 
          for his consent, the which he refused by reason of 
          your Majesty's Instruction, and at the opening the 
          present session the aforesaid Instruction being again 
          recommended by the Governor, has rendered the 
          severall attempts of this Court for H.E.'s support 
          without the settlement of a sallary ineffectuall. Your 
          Majesty's good subjects of this Province are also 
          under great difficultys on account of your Majesty's 
          30th Instruction, whereby as it is understood and 
          proposed to be practised on, the Treasury of this 
          Province is taken from the care of the House of Representatives 
          and all the money therein subjected to the 
          will and pleasure of the Governor and Councill, without 
          possibility of redress how unjustly soever the money 
          in the Treasury may be misapplyed, this the House of 
          Representatives cannot but humbly apprehend to 
          be against common right and equity ; that those who 
          grant and whose constituents pay all the publick 
          money should neither see the accounts whereby the 
          Province becomes indebted to prevent misapplications 
          or unjust paymts. of the money nor when it is mis- 
          applied or wasted be in any way of obtaining relict ; for 
          the direction in the Instruction as to a future inquiry 
          may serve to give us a more full sence and clearer view 
          of the loss and wast of the publick money, and thereby 
          increase our sorrow and distress, but neither affords 
          nor points at any sort of remedy, the House of Representatives 
          cannot impeach such as shall misapply the 
          money in the Treasury, according to the ancient and 
          well-known practice of the Honoble. House of Commons 
          before the Right Honoble. the Lords Spiritual and 
          Temporal etc. But the only methods that seem by 
          this Instruction to be left the House of Representatives, 
          are either to supply the Treasury with money as long 
          as the people they represent have any, let their money 
          be never so much imbezzelled, or otherwise to refuse 
          all supply and leave the Treasury empty which would 
          be in effect to dismantle all the forts and garrisons 
          leave the Government defenceless, and put an end to 
          all safety. As to which severall Instructions your 
          Majesty's most dutyful subjects humbly implore your 
          Majesty's favour and compassion that the Government 
          here may be permitted to go on in a way that is 
          practicable, in paying what they are in arrears, and 
          to support your Majesty's Governor suitable to the 
          dignity of your Majesty's commission, and in order 
          thereunto, most humbly beg that your Majesty would 
          be graciously pleased to grant your royall order of 
          leave to your present Governor to accept of what has 
          been or may be offered him from time to time, for his 
          ample and honourable support when he shall deem 
          it to be so, and that there may be the usuall securitys 
          allowed as to the money in the Treasury. Signed, In

          Governor Belcher to the same. Since his letter of 12th 
          June, has heard from Col. Dunbar that he has received H.M. 
          Commission to be Lt. Governor of N.H., and quickly intended 
          thither. Continues : Whereupon I gave orders to the 
          President of H.M. Council there, that upon his arrival he should 
          summon the Council, and have his Commission publisht with 
          the usuall solemnity, and with all possible respect to H.M., 
          which was accordingly done, and Collo. Dunbar thank'd me 
          therefor. Soon after which the Assembly sat att the time to 
          which I had prorogu'd it, on the special business of the disputed 
          boundaries betwixt <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts</placeName> 
          and <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">Newhamshire</placeName>, and 
          my orders to the President of the Councill (before Collo. Dunbar's 
          arrival) were to go upon no other affair att that time, and in case 
          any vote was agreed to by the Councill and Representatives, to 
          send it hither to me, to approve and sign. Upon this, my Lord 
          Duke, the Lt. Governor wrote me word he had litterally executed 
          my orders, and wou'd untill he had the words of his Commission 
          viz. in case of the Capn. Generalls death or absence explained to 
          him from home. To which etc. I wrote him, that the King in 
          his royall instruction does not call my being in the Massachusetts 
          an absence from Newhamshire, and that former Lt. Governours 
          of New Hampshire had acted by the order of the Governour-in- 
          Chief, altho' he was in the Massachusetts, and this my Lord 
          Duke is certainly fact, and I think to be supported with the 
          greatest justice and reason. If while the Captn. Generall and 
          Governour-in-Chief is but 60 miles from New Hampshire, his 
          Lieutenant shall presume to interfere with or dispute his orders, 
          it must certainly lead to great confusion in the King's Govern- 
          ment by weakning the authority of his Governour and thereby 
          lessning the King's honour. I therefore hope with great 
          deference to your Grace that no applications of my Lt. Governour 
          will prevail to debarr me of any part of the power and honour 
          which H.M. has in his great grace and favour conferr'd upon 
          me, and which my predecessors have enjoy'd. I have not, my 
          Lord Duke, been arriv'd from <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">great Brittain</placeName> quite eleven 
          months, and I have made three journeys to H.M. province of 
          New Hamshire and am going thither again in a few weeks, by 
          which your Grace will see I do everything in my power for H.M. 
          honour and service there. Nor have I receiv'd from that 
          Government half so much as was the charge of my Commission, 
          and in the Massachusetts your Grace is sensible I have not 
          receiv'd one farthing, tho' I have been and am att a great 
          expence etc. Repeats the request that Col. Dunbar may not be 
          countenanced in his attempts to subvert his authority etc.

          Lt. Governor Gooch to the Council of Trade and 
          Plantations. Refers to enclosed public papers and former letter 
          relating to the dispute with the Agent of Lord Fairfax concerning the bounds of 
          <placeName ref="#us_va_northernneck" role="direct">the Northern Neck</placeName> etc.  (v. C.S.P. June 29, 1729). 
          Continues : Since which the people in <placeName ref="#us_va" role="direct">this Dominion</placeName> as well 
          as many strangers from <placeName ref="#us_pa" role="direct">Pensilvania</placeName> have discovered a strong 
          inclination to extend our settlements on the western side of the 
          <placeName ref="#mt_blueridge" role="direct">great mountains</placeName>, and on the 
          <placeName ref="#rv_goosecreek" role="direct">River Cohongaroonton</placeName>, under 
          grants from this Government to hold their lands of the Crown, 
          to which they urge too that land doth of right belong, as lying 
          beyound any part of those rivers called <placeName ref="#rv_rappahannock" role="direct">Rappahannock</placeName> or 
          <placeName ref="#rv_potomac" role="direct">Potomack</placeName> etc. : On the other hand the Proprietor's Agent 
          insists that not only the main stream, which forms those rivers, 
          but all other rivers and streams which communicate therewith, 
          by what names soever they are known, and the lands 
          encompassed thereby are within the limits of his grant. 
          Notwithstanding which, I have hitherto according to the advice of the 
          Council allowed such as have applied for grants of those lands to 
          seat thereon with promise of patents so soon as they bring the 
          number of people they propose to settle that frontier ; judging 
          that the Proprietor's charter can't have so large a construction 
          as is pretended, and being sensible how much it is for H.M. 
          interest to encourage such settlements, since by that means 
          we may in a few years get possession of <placeName ref="#lk_great" role="indirect">the Lakes</placeName>, and be in a 
          condition to prevent the French surrounding us by their 
          settlements. Until this matter is adjusted with Ld. Fairfax, I shal, 
          as much as in me lieth, prevent every uneasiness that might 
          interrupt our present purpose, hoping if it is not likely to meet 
          with a speedy determination, that your Lordships will advise 
          me in what manner I shal proceed in the disposal of those lands 
          and in the protection of the people who take grants under the 
          Crown, from the encroachment of the Proprietor's Agent. It 
          is some time since I informed your Lordships how necessary 
          it is to secure the mouth of <placeName ref="#rv_james" role="direct">James River</placeName> by a fort or at least a 
          substantial battery ; and at the same time I wrote to the Board 
          of Ordinance for some cannon and other stores, to which letter 
          I sent a duplicate, but have received no answer ; and now that 
          I am putting in order the other batterys, which are become 
          ruinous, I should be glad not only to receive your Lordships' 
          sentiments thereon, but to be supplied also with ordnance and 
          stores suitable to such a work, and doubt not your Lordships' 
          representation to that Board will procure what is necessary, 
          about a dozen of six and thirty pounders and four eighteen 
          pounders with strong carriages etc., and a sufficient quantity 
          of shot, and then I shal send home the old guns upon that 
          ruined battery, which are no longer fit for service, with above 
          thirty pieces of cannon which I took out of Rappahannock 
          River where they had been about three-score years etc. Our 
          stores of powder are become very small, for 'tis now a great 
          many years since any was sent in, and some of that which 
          remains is decayed and unfit for service. I hope by your 
          Lordships' favour to receive a speedy supply, being very desirous 
          to provide against the insults of pirates, which we have reason 
          to expect from the usual encrease of that kind of vermin in times 
          of peace, and to secure us against the insurrection of our slaves, 
          the enemy I do assure your Lordships we have great reason to 
          be apprehensive of. Your Lordships will observe from the 
          Council Journal what preparations are made towards putting 
          in execution the Act for amending the staple of tobacco etc., 
          it is now two moneths since Commissioners were appointed to 
          direct the building of the warehouses, and almost as long since 
          we made choice of Inspectors, in which all immaginable care 
          has been taken with regard to the skill and integrity of the 
          persons and the ability of their securitys. It was absolutely 
          necessary to enter so early on the building the warehouses, 
          because of the length of time requisite for finishing so great a 
          work, and the advantage of the summer for erecting the wharfs, 
          which could not be so well carried out in an uncertain season ; 
          however I deferr'd this until point of time would admit of no 
          delay and then boldly entered upon it through various dis- 
          couraging reports, being satisfied that no substantial objection 
          could be made against the law. But notwithstanding the 
          assurance I have always entertained that your Lordships would 
          not suffer a law to miscarry which is so well calculated to do 
          justice to the Crown in all its revenue, to establish a fair and 
          honest measure of dealing between man and man, to encourage 
          the adventures of the fair trader, to raise a sinking trade, and 
          when once we are well fixed in it, to give a more easy and quick 
          dispatch to the ships sent hither on freight, it is with great 
          concern that I am obliged to represent to your Lordships, that 
          the suspense under which this law has layn, has afforded an 
          oppertunity to the masters of ships and others to propagate 
          divers storys, sometimes as if a repeal was certainly to be 
          expected, and at other times, and what is now agreed by all, 
          that it is only to continue during one crop and then to be 
          annulled : by this means many people who intended to build 
          vessels for the more speedy lading of their ships have been 
          discouraged, which I doubt not was the principal aim of those 
          reports, and will in some measure have their effect in retarding 
          the dispatch of the ships this next year, who I fear on this very 
          account will not get their lading so soon as otherwise they would 
          have done. But notwithstanding these artifices practiced here 
          by those who are by this law restrained from pilfering 
          and running tobacco, I hope the advantages of it will be 
          found, tho' perhaps not such as I should have expected, had I 
          gone on without opposition, and no handle given to work upon 
          the apprehensions of the people. And lest the same game 
          should be played over again, and the people still kept under the 
          like fears to the obstructing the good effects of this law, I humbly 
          intreat your Lordships to obtain H.M. royal approbation of 
          it for the time it is to continue, which I am perswaded will add 
          so great force to the measures projected thereby, as will clearly 
          demonstrate its usefulness both to the encrease of the Customs, 
          the advancing the value and goodness of the staple of this 
          country, and the great ease and benefit of all traders. I have 
          this one truth to add which will not be denied by any one that 
          goes from hence, that the common planters are so far from being 
          discouraged by the supposed charges and hardships pretended 
          to be imposed on them by this law, that there never was known 
          so great a crop of tobacco on the ground as at present, the 
          planters exerting their utmost industry, which I hope will put 
          to silence the false reasonings of those who suggest imaginary 
          fears of its lessening the importation and consequently the 
          revenue, when 'tis plain from experience that the people of 
          Virginia can never be diverted from making tobacco but only 
          by the lowness of its price. Whilst I was writting what is 
          above, I recd. advice of a petition prepared by the merchants of 
          <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="indirect">London</placeName> and <placeName ref="#en_bristol" role="indirect">Bristol</placeName> 
          trading to <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">America</placeName>, and designed to be 
          presented to the Parliament for an act to be passed, prohibiting 
          and makeing void all laws passed in the Plantations laying 
          dutys which may affect the trade or shipping of <placeName ref="#gb" role="indirect">Great Britain</placeName>; 
          that lands in America may be lyable to the payments of debts ; 
          and appeals allowed for any sum exceeding 100£. When I 
          considered, my Lords, how long and happily the British subjects 
          have traded to <placeName ref="#british_indies" role="secondary">America</placeName> and acquired great riches under the 
          ancient establishment made in these parts by the Crown, 
          sett forth in the Royal Charters and Instructions, without 
          seeking to abridge the people of the Plantations of their birth- 
          right as Englishmen, or limiting the Crown in the methods of 
          Government, I must confess I was somewhat startled, for 
          which reason I cannot forbear laying before your Lordships 
          my thoughts on this extraordinary attempt of the merchants, 
          tho' what I shal offer will be undigested, having had little 
          leisure to discourse of it. As to laws affecting trade etc., 'tis 
          no easy matter to guess how far they design this shall extend. 
          Neither of the duties by which the Government is supported, 
          and thereby British trade and shipping encouraged and 
          protected, can be set aside without weakening it, etc. 
          Continues : There seems to be a farther view in this scheme, 
          for if no dutys or fees are to be established here to affect their 
          trade, then there can be no regulation of the tobacco trade, 
          no penaltys on lading bulk tobacco, and pillaging or changing 
          the freighters' hogsheads, and our late act for amending the 
          staple of tobacco must fall in course : and indeed I suspect 
          the petition is by a side wind levelled at that act, for the act 
          carrys too clear a countenance of justice and honesty to be 
          attacked openly by itself. But above this, such a petition is, 
          with submission, a great disrespect to the King whose 
          instructions and orders to His Governors are no more to be 
          relied on, though always fully complied with as far as the 
          nature of the subject matter would admit. Besides H.M. has 
          it always in his power to make void any act inconsistent with the 
          interest of the British subject etc. Continues : The proposal of 
          making of lands lyable to the payment of debts is not treating 
          the people in the Plantations as if they were English subjects : 
          lands here are held by the same tenure as in <placeName ref="#en" role="indirect">England</placeName>, and are 
          now lyable to the payment of debts in the same manner as lands 
          in England are, and the British merchant may as easily come 
          at them after judgment obtained in the Courts of America, 
          as any man here can do, or as if the lands lay in England on 
          suits brought there. Common justice requires that legal 
          remedys should be reciprocal, and whenever a law shall pass 
          in England making real estates subject to debts in any other 
          manner than now they are, the Plantations will no doubt be 
          very easie under such a petition. But whilst the people here 
          have no method to recover their demands out of the lands of 
          the merchant, and are too remote to be admitted to the benefit 
          of the Commission of Bankruptcy sued out against insolvent 
          merchants, it would be hard to lay so unequal a burden on 
          them alone, which in a few years must prove the ruin of the 
          Plantation, or else sett them upon supplying themselves wth. 
          manufactures of their own without being beholden to their 
          Mother-country under such hard terms ; but it seems the 
          petitioners only look to present interest without regarding 
          what the consequence may be in future generations. The last 
          thing proposed as to appeals for 100£. value or upwards is no 
          less unreasonable, as it would be attended with the most 
          fatal consequences to the Plantation, as will appear from what 
          frequently happens etc. ; A planter consigns 10 hhds. of tobacco 
          to his merchant in London, desiring him to sell them and out 
          of the produce to send him such and such goods. The 
          merchant sends the goods, and with them an account of sales 
          of the tobacco ; the next year more tobacco is consigned and 
          more goods are sent for, and then comes an account current 
          wherein the planter has credit for his first tobacco consigned, 
          and so the correspondence continues for three or four years ; 
          at last the merchant sends the planter a letter telling him that 
          the tobacconist to whom he sold four or five hogsheads of his 
          first consigned tobacco is broke, that the money is lost, and 
          the planter must repay it ; and for that money and some other 
          small debt making in all 100£. he is sued. In this case, though 
          no Court or Jury can possibly charge the planter with this loss 
          after three years time, when it is proved that the merchant 
          never sells without ready money, or on six months credit at 
          most, and therefore the merchant must have given farther 
          credit on his own accot. and risque, and thereupon there is a 
          verdict here for the planter : yet if the bill now petitioned for 
          passes, there is an appeal, and the poor planter knowing no 
          man in England to whom he can entrust the defences there, 
          and considering the charge he must be at of at least 70£., or 80 
          on the tryal in England, will find it more for his interest to 
          pay what is unjustly charged him than to defend himself at 
          such an expence. Many more instances may be given as I 
          am told of the like hardships in the matter of accots. which the 
          planters here must submit to, if appeals be allowed for so small 
          a sum etc., for a voyage from America to England and four or 
          five moneths attendance there for the hearing of an appeal is 
          no trifling expence. So that I humbly conceive the sum already 
          limited by H.M. Instructions is much more reasonable etc. 
          Continues : If what the petitioners propose, tended any way 
          to the interest of the British trade, to the securing the 
          dependency of the Plantations to the Crown, or to the con- 
          sumption of the British manufactures, I should be far from 
          objecting against them ; But 'tis plain to me they must have 
          a quite contrary effect in all these particulars, seeing they 
          aim at depriving the Plantations of the means of supporting the 
          respective Governments and providing for their necessary 
          defence in time of danger, tend to alienate the affections of the 
          people from their Mother-Country, and to compel them to fall 
          on other means to subsist and cloath their familys than by 
          British manufactures, and in short the whole project is so very 
          unreasonable, that the best thing I can say of the gentlemen 
          concerned in the petition is, that they know not what they ask. 
          I have still one thing more to lay before your Lordships which 
          shal be done by the hands of our Agent, in order to have the 
          opinion of the Attorney and Sollicitor General, whether slaves, 
          Christians or not, convicted in the Plantations of such crimes 
          as by the laws of England are within the benefit of clergy, are 
          entitled to the priviledge of the statutes of England concerning 
          Clergy etc. Signed, William Gooch. Endorsed, Recd. 4th Oct.,

          Col. Dunbar to Mr. Popple. Was at <placeName ref="#us_me_frederick" role="direct">Fredericks Fort</placeName>
          when he received his Commission for Lt. Govr. etc. Is wholly 
          indebted to the Council of Trade for that favour and will do 
          his best to deserve their good opinion etc. Continues : I waited 
          some time at Fredericks Fort to receive an officer and a partie 
          of soldiers from Collo. Philips regiment from <placeName ref="#ca_ns" role="direct">Nova Scotia</placeName> etc. 
          I sent for them according to my Instructions upon rumours 
          that the Indians were prejudiced against us, in September last, 
          but they did not arrive until the 14th of June, the 23rd of the 
          same month I sailed thence, and landed here next day ; I was 
          very kindly reced. by the Gentn., but my Commission was not 
          published until the 28th that they might have time to shew 
          some honours which Govr. Belcher was pleased to order upon 
          that occasion, and which I would willingly have declined ; 
          upon the first inst. the Assembly sat, and by a written order 
          from <placeName ref="#us_ma_boston" role="direct">Boston</placeName> from the Chief Governour were only to renew a 
          former vote impowering a Committee to meet another from 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma" role="direct">the Massachusetts Bay</placeName> at 
          <placeName ref="#us_ma_newbury" role="direct">Newbury</placeName> about setling the lines, and 
          then immediately to prorogue them to September. I was 
          surprized a few moments before I had the honour to meet the 
          Assembly to be told that a speech was expected from me, and 
          it put me under concern as I have no talent that way, herewith 
          I send you a copy of it and the answer of the House of Repre- 
          sentatives, but intreat it may not be made a Coffee House 
          diversion by exposing it in print (more majorum). I was not 
          less surprized to be informed from the sd. order from the 
          Governour, that any vote passed here must be sent to him to 
          Boston to be signed, and when I asked the opinion of the Council 
          thereupon and whether or no the chief Governour was then 
          present or absent, I was answered that he was deemed to be 
          virtually present, and I had nothing to do but obey his orders. 
          A majority of the Council (there were but six present) were of 
          that opinion they are under some obligations to him but the 
          other Gentn. quoted instances where Lieut. Govrs. have held 
          General Assemblies, passed acts and done every other act of 
          Governmt. in his own name when the Chief Govr. was at Boston, 
          however I was inclined to avoid disputes with him as may be 
          seen by a copy of a letter I wrote to him on the 3rd instant, 
          with his answer to it, so that I am of so little significancy that 
          I am really ashamed ; however if my Lords Commissioners are 
          of opinion against me I shall chearfully submit, tho' Mr. Belcher 
          is the very last man upon the globe that I would choose to be 
          a sub to, it is incredible how he has maltreated me, he has not 
          only murthered my character in this country, by saying I was 
          a poor lying insignificant fellow, but influenced as great acts of 
          injustice against me as ever was imposed upon any man etc. 
          Complains that he has intercepted his letters and handed about 
          one from his wife etc. (v. July 15th). Continues : I am really 
          apt to beleive it is a counterfeit letter, because I cannot conceive 
          what my wife could write to me to give my enemies so much 
          pleasure ; I lately had an accot. of this attempt of Mr. Belcher's 
          to print the letter from a gentn. of fortune and veracity, which 
          provoked me to write a letter to him. Encloses copy to the 
          Board. Continues : If it be thought I was too warm, I hope 
          the provocation will justifie me ; after this I fear my accot. of 
          the present state of this province etc. may be tho't somewhat 
          prejudiced against Governour Belcher ; it is most certain that 
          no colony can be in greater confusion, he has turned out so 
          many gentn. from the country imployments without consulting 
          the Council or shewing that he had a power in himself by his 
          Instructions etc., that there is a stagnation of Justice, no 
          Superior Court having sat since he displaced the old Judges, 
          of which, now not one amongst the four of that Court ; the 
          Speaker Collo. Wiggins was one, and upon the Governour's 
          putting a man before him in a new Commission, who had ever 
          been his inferiour, he declined acting for which he was by an 
          unpresidented written order striped of all imployments in open 
          Court, having been Collo. of one of the regiments and for many 
          years in Commission of the Peace, he is a man of a very good 
          character and much esteemed etc. The Governour has not yet 
          appointed any Justices of the Peace in the town where Collo. 
          Wiggins lives, nor in four other townships where he hath turned 
          out gentn. who have long served in that Commission, the country 
          imployments are worth nothing and none but gentn. of fortune 
          can support ym., a Judge of the Superiour Court I am told is not 
          worth more than thirteen pounds pr. annum, which is about 
          2d. per diem sterl. He has removed the Courts from this which 
          is the Province town to 3 country towns so that but one of four 
          yearly Courts sit here, he is said to be influenced to do all this 
          by one Mr. Waldron, an Attorney, who has been for some time 
          Clerk of the Council, he is now a Member of it, by the Govr's. 
          appointment, tho' there was no vacancy that he had power to 
          fill, untill they prevailed upon Mr. Westbrook his father-in-law 
          to resign, he is also made a Judge, and a Justice of the Peace, 
          and is commissioned Province Secretary which is new here, he is 
          very obnoxious to many of the better sort of people and to him 
          are imputed all the inconveniencies now upon the Province. 
          I have had frequent complaints from the country which you'l 
          find I represented to H.E., and you'l see by his answer to how 
          little purpose. I fear that I am remiss in my duty in not 
          remedying them myself, and beleive I shall, if he does not soon 
          appoint magistrates ; no two were ever more like to like then 
          Mr. Belcher and his chief Minister which he has the assurance to 
          call Sr. Robert, this is fact and cannot be denyed he has another 
          at Boston which he himself calls so, one Pemberton whom he 
          sends on errants, anybody who has been at Boston can vouch 
          this, Mr. Dalton a gentn. now in <placeName ref="#en_lon" role="secondary">Londo</placeName>. of extraordinary good 
          character and Mr. Barker a relation to Sr. Thomas Frankland 
          can vouch it ; the sudden prorogation of the Assembly here 
          made the country a little dissatisfied with me, until the 
          Governour's orders were made publick for so doing ; this 
          prevented them from addressing H.M. and therefore some of 
          the Council and Assembly the three members for this town 
          and some other of the chief inhabitants have joyned in a 
          memorial to my Lords Commissioners which they have requested 
          me to transmit, and to pray a speedy answer. I herewith send 
          it and humbly recommend it to their Lordships it could not be 
          imagined that from my last arrival here as Lieut. Governour 
          I could know so much as I do of the state of the country. I 
          have formerly spent part of my time here as Surveyor, and in 
          my letters home I always did them the justice to say how civil 
          and respectful they were to the King's Officers, and a very 
          different people from their neighbours of the Massachusetts, 
          who too frequently shew their disregard to H.M. servants ; I 
          mention this only because it has been represented here that I 
          had given an ill character of them at home, which would have 
          been false and unjust ; I heartily wish they were under a 
          seperate Govermt. from the Massachusetts for the reasons in 
          their memorial and I hope it will not be imagined I am induced 
          to be of this opinion in hopes of being the man myself, the 
          Province is small and unable at present to give a seperate 
          Governour anything more then they have now setled upon 
          their chief Governour, and therefore it would be worth nobody's 
          acceptance but one of themselves, the late Lieut. Governour 
          was born here and there are many worthy gentn. and good 
          subjects, Mr. George Jaffry is the second in the Council, Collo. 
          Walton the first being ancient, is passed being fit, and when 
          my Lords are pleased to remove me, I take leave to recommend 
          Mr. Jaffry as the properest person to serve H.M. I ought to 
          do the gentn. the justice, to own that there are others well 
          deserving but if they had the nomination themselves, Mr. 
          Jaffry would be the man etc. Refers to enclosures. Upon 
          reading them I beg my Lords will observe the difference in the 
          wording of the two acts from this Province and the Massachu- 
          setts, for adjusting the lines between ym., and whether one 
          do's not shew a better disposition towards it than the other ; 
          it is not to be expected it can be setled on <placeName ref="#n_america" role="secondary">this side the water</placeName>, 
          an order from H.M. with an explanation of the words relating 
          to it, and the line of longitude, in the last Charter must 
          determine it, and they hope they will not be circumscribed by 
          the northerly course of the turn of <placeName ref="#rv_merrimack" role="boundary">Merrimack River</placeName> but that 
          their westerly bounds will extend as farr as their neighbours 
          on either side ; If the charter of the Massachusetts is to be 
          vacated then Merrimack River will be the natural bounds 
          between the two as far as the course is near westerly, and 
          whenever that happens the <placeName ref="#us_me" role="direct">Province of Main</placeName> added to 
          <placeName ref="#us_nh" role="direct">New Hampshire</placeName> would be a handsome and extensive Governmt. 
          and would be convenient and pleasing to both people ; there 
          is another wide difference between New Hampshire and their 
          neighbours, there they are Independants, and great zealots, 
          here they are moderate and inclining to the Church of <placeName ref="#en" role="descriptive">England</placeName>, 
          tho' there never was one within the Province ; the Gentn. of 
          this town, and who are generally in disgrace with H.E., have 
          made handsome subscriptions for building a church, and are 
          upon beginning it, but the maintenance of a Minister at first 
          will be very heavy upon ym. as the congregation will not be 
          very numerous, they are upon sending a modest and ingenious 
          gentleman to be ordained by my Lord Bishop of London, who 
          has been some years a preacher in this country, he was bred 
          at <placeName ref="#us_ma_cambridge" role="indirect">Cambridge</placeName> Colledge near Boston and is very desirous of being 
          in orders, but discouraged from the thoughts of returning to 
          this country because the maintenance of Ministers is generally 
          very small, and no chance for a man of any merit to preferment. 
          I'll take the liberty to recommend him to my Lord's interest 
          to get some encouragemt. from H.M. as well from the Society 
          for propagating the Gospel, and I hope such would have a very 
          good effect in these parts. Govr. Belcher bro't over some 
          Church plate and ornamts. for one of the churches at Boston, 
          as H.M. bounty, I humbly pray my Lords will recommend this 
          new one for the like favour. Enumerates six present Councillors. 
          Continues : There is but one more vizt. Capt. Frost, but he is 
          uncapable having lost his speech and his limbs by the palsy etc. 
          Mr. Waldron is hitherto only recommended to H.M. for a 
          mandamus, but I earnestly intreat the favour that he may not 
          be of the number for the aforesd. reasons, and for the oppositions 
          he formerly gave me in conjunction with his father-in-law Mr. 
          Westbrook when I made a formal tender of 130 mast trees 
          which were seized here by my Deputies, this may appear by 
          a copy of a most scurilous letter wrote by Mr. Waldron, and 
          signed by Mr. Westbrook to the late Lieut. Governour here, 
          wherein he and I were much abused, which copy I transmitted 
          to you 18 months ago, and which I request you will once more 
          lay before the Board. As Lieut. Governour I am told I have 
          no place nor vote at the Council table when the Chief Governour 
          is there. I therefore pray that I may have an order or qualification
          to regulate as my Lords intend it should be, and I should 
          take it as a very signal mark of their Lordps. to recommend 
          Mr. Benning Wentworth eldest son of the late Lieut. Govr., 
          Mr. Theodore Atkinson, Mr. Joshua Peirce senr., Collo. Andrew 
          Wiggin, and Collo. John Gilman to be of the Council ; my brother 
          will take out their mandamus's, these would only make up ten 
          of the number, and it would be a credit to me to be intrusted 
          with a blank mandamus or two to fill upon occasion ; the 
          gentn. that is about going to be ordained his name is William 
          Shurtaff, if my Lords would be pleased to recommend him to 
          be Province Secretary by H.M. Commission he is well qualified 
          and would be a help to him and his small congregation, it is 
          not worth above 25£. sterl. pr. annum. It is now time for me 
          to make an apology for this tedious epistle which with my 
          most humble duty I pray you will lay before my Lords and 
          favour me with an answer etc. Signed, D. Dunbar. Endorsed,

290. ii. Memorial of members of Council and of Assembly 
and of other inhabitants of New Hampshire to the 
Council of Trade and Plantations 10th July, 1731. 
We etc. inhabitants of H.M. loyal and dutiful! tho' 
small and poore Province of New Hampshire in America 
being lately dissapointed of an opertunity of addressing 
our most gracious King from the Representatives of 
our people in General Court assembled and setting 
forth the hardships we suffer by the dispute about 
the lines between us and the Massachusetts Bay, 
this dissapointment being occasioned by a sudden 
prorogation after one day's sitting by our Lieut. 
Governour pursuant to directions sent from our Chief 
Governour from Boston, which was very surprising 
to the House of Representatives here who at the 
instant of prorogation were prepairing such address, 
doe therefore most humbly pray to be permitted to 
lay our said hardships before your Lordships. W T hen 
our present Chief Governour was pleased to com- 
municate to us the Royal Instruction for settling the 
said lines we received them with all thankfulness and 
duty and imediately proceeded upon naming our 
Commissioners in the very manner prescribed in the 
Instructions, but our choice not being approved by 
H.E. and very difficult to find others qualified we 
readily came into other measures to facilitate the 
settlement of the said lines, as may appear by attested 
coppys .of the proceedings thereupon. All which 
proving ineffectual and having too much reason to be- 
leive that our neighbours of the Massachusetts Bay doe 
not desire to have the lines fixed because wee apprehend 
that they are making settlements which will be deemed

farr on our side the lines and are frequently exercising 
an authority and jurisdiction nine, tenn and eleven 
miles to the northward of Merrymack River by seizing 
and carrying away some of our inhabitants, imprisoning 
sueing and fineing them at their courts on the south 
side of the sd. river to the great dammage and dis- 
couragement of many poor familys. We therefore 
humbly pray your Lordships favour that H.M. may 
be addressed to interpose and give his royal orders 
for ascertaining and determining the lines in dispute 
to which we shall cheerfully submit as we have always 
done to his pleasure well knowing that H.M. can have 
no other intentions than the wellfair, prosperity and 
ease of his loyal subjects. We further begg leave to 
represent to your Lordships that this small Province 
labours under vast disadvantages by being under the 
Government of the same person with the Massachusetts 
as that Province is very considerable in respect to us, 
and the Governor's sallary chiefly arising there. We 
have been denied and cannot at any time reasonably 
hope for his assent to some acts which would be 
beneficial to our small Province, which if we were 
under a seperate Governour would not be denyed to 
us and which might also enable us much better to pay 
the sallary which we have already pursuant to H.M. 
Instruction settled upon our Chief Governour, so as 
to enable a Governour of our own to support that 
rank. If w r e might presume to begg this favour of 
his Majesty it would be such an act of his goodness as 
would forever make His memory deare to our posterity 
as his royal person is now to us. To mention any other 
greivance which we feel we fear would render us too 
troublesome to your Lordships and imploye more of 
your precious time than our proportion, and they are 
such as might easily be remedyed here, several of our 
towns are at this time destitute of any magistrate 
insomuch that a constable has come to the town of 
Portsmouth 38 miles to be sw r orn into his office, and no 
Justice of the Peace nearer to the town he came from 
then 23 miles, this misfortune we labour under by an 
unhappy displeasure conceived against some of us by 
our Cheif Governour as we apprehend tho' we humbly 
are of opinion without the least grounds, we having 
not only complyed with everything he asked of us in 
his Majesties, but passed a vote for paying him six 
months sallary beforehand, whereby in case of death 
or removal we may be lyable to pay the same or most 
part thereof to his successor. Pray for an answer to 
this remonstrance etc. Signed, Geo. Jaffrey, Andrew

a gentleman of a most uneasy restless temper, and I wish to 
God I was clear of him. I am sorry while I tell your Lordships

295. Council of Trade and Plantations to the King. Repre- 
sentation upon Act of Jamaica for the better regulating slaves 
etc., (for reasons set out, A.P.C. III. pp. 344, 345 q.v.) The Act 
in effect repeals former laws passed at Jamaica in favour of 
several negroes who had been made free for their faithful 
services, and their descendants, and especially John Williams, 
his wife, and descendants." It is also impolitick in its tendency 
with respect to the interest and welfare of Jamaica, as well as 
unequitable to the persons above mentioned ; and to the whole 
order of free negroes, since it manifestly tends to discourage the 
integrity of the slaves in that island, as well as the industry of 
those who are become free : whereas it would in our humble 
opinion be very prudent, eminently to reward all extraordinary 
examples of fidelity and virtue amongst the negroes of all 
denominations for the better governing of a people whose 
service is so essential to the prosperity both of this Colony and 
of all your Majesty's Plantations. We therefore take leave \,o 
lay this act before your Majesty for your disapprobation.

Hampshire against him. Continues : I have good reason to

believe my Lt. Governor is att the head of this affair. Your 
Grace will upon this judge how inconsistent it is with the King's 
honour and service to have Collo. Dunbar continu'd to interfere 
and give trouble to the King's Governor etc. Continues : I 
now take the opportunity to give your Grace ten thousand 
thanks for the stop you put to his Commission for some time 
(as my friends inform'd me), and I wish to God it had been 
finally stopt, for he is the most restless uneasy Gentleman I 
ever had to do with. I woud still begg of your Grace he may 
be otherwise provided for, and that Coll. Henry Sherburn might 
be my Lieutenant Governor etc. Col. Dunbar's ill nature and 
prejudice against him are such that he supposes the same com- 
plaints against his are of the same kind as his pompous and 
fictitious complaint about Frederick's Fort, by which also much 
trouble was caused owing to his not having been allowed to see 
its contents before being sent home etc. When he himself 
exhibited a complaint against Governor Burnett at Whitehall, 
the answer was that no proceedings could be made upon it but 
to serve Governor Burnett with a copy for his answer etc. 
Concludes : I remember an observation of a great man when 
I was att Whitehall upon an opposition made in the house of 
Commons, that the pasture was streight and the cattle numerous. 
This may it please your Grace (comparing small things with 
great) is the case att New Hampshire. Men that are out of 
office, wou'd feign be in, and because they can't, the next thing 
is to murmur and grumble etc. Awaits copy of the complaint 
for his answer. Signed, J. Belcher. 2 pp. [C.O. 5, 898. No.
